2 c. white sugar
2 c. Brown sugar, packed
4 eggs
2 c. shortening
2 c. milk
4 t. soda and 1 t. salt
1/2 t. nutmeg
2 T. baking powder
10  c. flour
1 t. vanilla
     Mix dry ingredients except sugars.   Cream sugars with shortening and add eggs and vanilla.  Add dry ingredients and milk alternately until smooth.  Roll out 1/8" thick or chill for one hour and put through  a cookie press.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown and puffy.  Makes about 10 dozen cut-out cookies.  This is a double batch but you will find they won`t last very long and they stay soft for a really long time if they are covered.  My kids love them.  Good luck.
