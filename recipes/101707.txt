In saucepan, combine filling ingredients. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened. Set aside to cool. In mixing bowl, cream butter and sugars. Add egg, vanilla, and salt; beat well. Add flour; mix well. Shape dough into 1in. balls. Flatten and place 1/4tsp filling in center. Fold and reshape into balls. Place on greased cookie sheet. Bake 350 for 12-15 minutes. Cool. In saucepan cook caramels and evaporated milk until melted and smooth. Insert toothpick into each cookie and dip in caramel until completely covered. Dip bottoms in nuts. Place on racks until set.
It says it makes 3 dozen, but only makes 1 1/2 dozen. I double it. Also the toothpicks DO NOT work very well. We use tongs and put the toothpicks in after the caramel, before the nuts, so they are easier to pick up when you eat them.
