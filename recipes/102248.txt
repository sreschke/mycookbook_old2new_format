These small birds are fabulous for fuss-free serving because each person gets a whole hen. Cooking time will vary, depending on the size of the birds. Allow an extra 10 to 20 minutes for larger hens.

2 Cornish game hens (1 to 1 1/2 pounds each) 
2 tablespoons extra-virgin or pure olive oil, divided
1 teaspoon kosher salt or 1/2 teaspoon regular salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 medium onion, finely chopped 
1 medium garlic clove, minced 
3 tablespoons white wine 
1 1/2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme 

1.Heat oven to 425øF. Arrange hens breast side up on a broiler pan. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the oil over the hens, spreading over entire surface. Sprinkle all over with salt and pepper. Bake 20 minutes.
2.Meanwhile, heat remaining tablespoon oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook onion 5 minutes, until translucent. Add garlic, and cook 1 minute more. Add wine, and boil 30 seconds; stir in mustard and thyme and remove from heat.
3.Reduce oven temperature to 350øF. Spoon sauce over breasts of hens (try to keep the chunky part of mixture on top of the birds). Bake 10 to 20 minutes more, until juices inside the thigh joint run clear when pierced with a knife.
