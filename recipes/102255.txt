  Recipe by: Rival and Brenda Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry; place in
  Crock-Pot.  In a saucepan, combine remaining ingredients and heat until
  smooth and hot.  Pour over chicken breasts. Cover and cook on low setting
  for 8 to 10 hours.  (I did on higher heat to speed things up. I added
  boiled potatoes and some paprik towards the end.)
