Use 1 can chicken to 2 pkg. crescent rolls. Put chicken in individual roll and fold over to make a ball. Place folded side down in 2 9X13 (sprayed) pans. Mix the other ingredients in a bowl and add milk to make it a thick creamy consistency. Pour mixture over the rolls, sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Bake in a preheated 400 oven for about 30 min. Serve over rice. This recipe feeds many, so adjust to fit "your crowd". This is our family's very favorite.
