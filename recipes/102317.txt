JELLY PREPARATION
1. Place 3 clean 250 or 236 mL Mason jars in a boiling water canner, fill with water, cover and boil hard 10 minutes. Set screw bands aside; heat snap lids in hot water, not boiling (180øF 82øC). Keep jars and snap lids hot until ready to use.
2. Measure ingredients (except pectin) for selected recipe into a large, deep stainless steel saucepan as specified in each recipe.
3. Over high heat, bring mixture to a full rolling boil. Stirring constantly, boil hard 1 minute. Remove from heat. Immediately stir in one pouch Liquid Pectin, mixing well.
4. Pour jelly into hot sterilized jars, dividing solids equally among jars and filling each jar to within 1/4 inch (5 mm) of top rim headspace. Wipe jar rims removing any stickiness. Centre snap lid on jar; apply screw band securely and firmly until resistance is met--fingertip tight. Do not overtighten. Place jar upright in canner; boiling water should cover lids by 1 inch (2.5 cm).
5. Cover canner; return water to boil. At altitudes up to 1,000 ft (305 m) process by boiling filled jars 5 minutes. Remove jars without tilting. Cool upright, until lids pop down, about 30 minutes. Do not retighten screw bands. When lids are concave, carefully invert, twist and/or rotate each jar to distribute solids throughout the jelly. The jar can be inverted temporarily but should not be allowed to stand upside-down for prolonged periods. Repeat as needed during the cooling/setting time, until solids are nicely suspended in the jelly. 

6. After 24 hours, check jar seals. Sealed lids curve downward. Remove screw bands; wipe and dry bands and jars. Store screw bands separately or replace loosely on jars, as desired. Label and store jars in a cool, dark place.
