2  pounds sweet potatoes (about 3) 
1 1/4  cups vegetable oil 
   Unsalted butter, for pans 
2  cups cake flour (not self-rising), plus more for pans 
4   large eggs 
2  cups sugar 
2  teaspoons baking powder 
1  teaspoon salt 
1  tablespoon ground cinnamon 
1  teaspoon ground nutmeg 
2  teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
3  tablespoons brandy 
1 1/2  cups unsalted macadamia nuts, toasted, coarsely chopped 
1  pound white chocolate 
2  cups heavy cream 
  
  1.  Heat oven to 400ø. Coat potatoes with 1/4 cup vegetable oil, and place on baking sheet. Bake until tender, 30 to 40 minutes. When cool enough to handle, remove skin, and mash flesh with a fork into coarse pur‚e. 
  
  2.  Lower oven temperature to 325ø. Butter two 8-by-1 1/2-inch round cake pans, dust with flour, and set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat eggs and sugar together on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1 cup vegetable oil; beat on medium speed until well combined. Add the cooled sweet potatoes; mix until combined. 
  
  3.  Sift together cake flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg; mix into sweet potato mixture. Mix in vanilla and brandy until combined. Remove batter from mixer; fold in 1 cup macadamia nuts by hand. 
  
  4.  Evenly distribute cake batter into prepared pans, and transfer to the oven. Bake until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let pans cool on a wire rack 10 minutes. Invert cakes onto rack; cool completely, about 1 1/4 hours. 
  
  5.  Meanwhile, chop white chocolate into small pieces; set aside. Bring 1 cup cream to a boil; pour over chocolate, whisking until chocolate is melted. Chill for 30 to 40 minutes. 
  
  6.  When chocolate mixture has cooled, pour remaining cup cream into an electric mixer; whip on medium until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Fold whipped cream into chocolate mixture until fully incorporated. 
  
  7.  Cut each cake layer in half horizontally, creating four layers. Spread 2/3 cup chocolate frosting on one layer, then stack next layer on top, and frost. Repeat frosting-and-stacking process until each layer is frosted. Spread remaining frosting on sides and top of cake. Arrange remaining 1/2 cup macadamia nuts on top of cake, and serve.
