1.  Preheat oven to 325F.  In medium saucepan, combine granulated sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt and the half-and-half.  Bring to boiling, stirring occasionally.  

2.  Meanwhile, in another saucepan, combine brown sugar and cornstarch.  Gradually whisk in hot half-and-half mixture.  Add butter; over medium heat, cook mixture, whisking constantly, 5 minutes or until boiling and thickened.  Simmer 1 minute.  Stir in vanilla.

3.  Pour mixture into prepared pie crust; sprinkle with cinnamon.  Bake 20 minutes or until top of pie is golden.  Place on wire rack; pie filling will be very loose but will thicken on cooling.  Cool completely before slicing.  Makes 10 servings.
