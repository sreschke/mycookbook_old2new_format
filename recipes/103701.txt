Whisk in remaining cake ingredients, blending thoroughly. Pour into the baking pan, spreading evenly. In a large bowl, whisk together pudding ingredients until sugar and cocoa are dissolved. Pour carefully over batter (pudding layer will be thin and runny). Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until top is firm to the touch.
