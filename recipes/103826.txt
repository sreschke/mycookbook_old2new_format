MISE EN PLACE 
 
While the French phrase mise en place?literally meaning ?putting into place??may sound fancy, the idea behind it is actually quite simple: It?s a basic cooking technique that involves preparing all the ingredients for a recipe prior to cooking. With every item measured, chopped, diced, or sliced according to the recipe?s instructions, the actual cooking of the dish takes less time and effort. Mise en place also requires that you read a recipe before beginning to cook?something that sounds obvious but is often overlooked. It is a terrible feeling to get halfway through a recipe before realizing you are missing an ingredient, or that something needed to marinate.
