*Turtle Cookies* 
Turtles may be slow, but they will quickly disappear from the platter when you guests see these fun and rich treats. This is the perfect holiday cookie for the chocolate lover in you. 1 1/2 cups flour 
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/8 teaspoon salt
Pecan halves
8 Caramels cut into fourths 
Mix the brown sugar, vanilla, margarine and 2 tablespoons of water in a large bowl. Add the flour and salt. Mix until ingredients hold together. On an ungreased cookie sheet clump together the pecans into small groups that resemble stars. You may have to break the pecans into shorter pieces because you will want the pecans to barely protrude from under a one inch round "shell" of cookie dough as if they were the head and feet of a turtle. 
When you have arranged some 25-30 of these (or as many as you can fit on a cookie sheet. With a teaspoon form little balls with the dough. Then insert the piece of caramel into the middle of the dough. Finally, place the dough over the pecan pieces as described in the above paragraph. Bake cookies in a 350 degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes. The cookies should be done but do not let them get too brown. While you are waiting for the cookies to bake prepare the Chocolate glaze as follows: 
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon water
1 ounce melted, unsweetened chocolate
1 teaspoon vanilla 
Beat together all ingredients until the glaze is smooth. You may have to add an extra teaspoon of water or two to make the glaze the desired consistency. 
After cookies are taken out of the oven and have cooled, dip their "shells" in the chocolate. This rich, tasty cookie is better than candy! And If you are having a cookie party, your guests may leave home with a couple, but it is questionable whether the cookies will ever reach their destination. 
This recipe makes about 30 cookies.
