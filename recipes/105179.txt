3-1/2 cups sugar
3/4 cup light corn syrup
1 T black gel-paste food coloring
5 t peppermint, cinnamon, or anise extract
1 t baking soda

Line an 8-inch square baking pan with a piece of aluminum foil large enough to overhang the sides by about 2 inches.  Set aside.

Bring, sugar, corn syrup and 3/4 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir to dissolve sugar, and wash down sides of pan with a pastry brush dipped in water to prevent crystals from forming.

Once mixture comes to a boil and all the sugar has dissolved, clip a candy thermometer to pan, and raise heat to high.  Continue cooking without stirring until mixture registers 300 degrees F (hard-crack stage).  Remove from heat.

Carefully add food coloring, extract, and baking soda; stir slowly with a clean wooden spoon until thoroughly combined and mixture no longer bubbles, about 2 minutes.

Pour into prepared pan, and let cool completely.

Lift foil to remove candy from pan and transfer candy to a large plastic bag.  Use a kitchen mallet or hammer to crush candy into pieces.
