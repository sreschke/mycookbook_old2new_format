  Ingredients

4 boneless skinless chicken breasts -- butterflied and,pounded 1/4
15 ounces  ricotta
2 1/2 ounces  parmesan
1 large  egg
1 roma tomato -- cut into small pieces
1/2  teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon  pepper
2 cups   your favorite pasta sauce

 1.  Preheat your oven to 350F. Start by making the ricotta filling. Dice the roma tomato
            into 1/4" dice. In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, parmesan, egg, tomato, olives,
            salt & pepper, thyme and oregano. Set aside. 

 2.   With a sharp knife, slice the breast in half so that it opens up like the folds of a book. 

 3.   Lay a sheet of plastic wrap over the breast and pound it until it is about 1/4" thick. Start
            at the center of the meat and gently pound, pushing your mallet out toward the edge
            of the meat. 
 
4.  Take a generous spoonful of the cheese mixture and place it in the center of the
            chicken breast. Fold one side over then the other, and gently roll the breast over the
            filling. 

 5.  I usually don't bother with string or toothpicks to hold the breast together. Just gently
            place the roll, seam side down in a shallow baking dish. Pour the pasta sauce around
            the chicken breasts and place in a preheated oven at 350F. Bake for 25-30 minutes.
            Serve with the pasta sauce poured over the roll.
