Recipe: Grated Potato Latkes 




16 to 20 latkes, depending on size 

- 2 large Russet potatoes (about 1 pound) unpeeled and washed well 
- 1 large onion, peeled and cut into quarters 
- 1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk 
- 4 tablespoons self-rising cake flour (see note) 
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
- ¬ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
- ? cup vegetable oil, for frying 
- Applesauce and sour cream for serving 

1. Cut each potato into quarters. Using a box grater, grate potatoes coarsely. Using a food processor with a coarse grating disk, grate the onion; it will turn mushy. Fit the processor with a metal chopping blade and add potatoes to onions. Pulse 4 or 5 times, until the potatoes are finely chopped. 

2. Add egg and egg yolk, pulsing just to combine. Working quickly to prevent potatoes from browning, transfer the mixture to a bowl and add the self-rising flour, or flour mixture, salt and pepper. Mix just until the flour disappears. 

3. Set a medium cast-iron or other heavy-bottom saut‚ pan over medium-high heat. Pour in about ¬-inch of vegetable oil and heat. Test the oil by placing a drop or two of batter into the pan to see if it sizzles. 

4. When oil is hot enough, use a tablespoon to scoop batter into hot pan. Flatten and shape immediately with the back of a spoon. When edges of the latke are brown and crisp, about 5 minutes, flip. Cook until the second side is browned, remove from the pan, and drain on paper towels. Serve with applesauce and sour cream 

Note: If self-rising flour isn't available, substitute 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour mixed with « teaspoon baking powder and ¬ teaspoon kosher salt.
