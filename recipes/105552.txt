1 lb. ground pork
1 tsp. ground ginger
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 qt. oil for frying (peanut)
2 tbsp. flour
2 tbsp. water
2 tbsp. shredded cabbage
2 oz. shredded carrots
8 egg roll wrappers

Season pork with ginger and garlic powder and mix thoroughly.  Heat mixture in a medium skillet, stirring, until pork is cooked through and no longer pink.  Set aside.
In another large skillet heat oil to about 375 degrees on medium high heat.  While oil is heating, combine flour and water in a bowl until they form a paste.  In a separate bowl combine the cabbage, carrots and reserved pork mixture.  Mix all together.  
Lay out one egg roll skin with a corner pointed toward you.  Place about a 1/4 to 1/3 c. of the cabbage, carrot and pork mixture on egg roll paper and fold corner up over the mixter.  Fold the left and right corners toward the center and continue to roll.  Brush a bit of the flour paste on the final corner to help seal the egg roll.  
Place the egg rolls into heated oil and fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown.  Remove from oil and drain on paper towels or rack.
