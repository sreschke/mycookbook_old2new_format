HERBED BALSAMIC CHICKEN BREASTS


Try this sauce on your favorite steak, such as strip, porterhouse or rib eye. The sauce also works well on grilled pork chops. Brush the sauce on the meat 2-3 minutes before taking it off the grill and serve the remaining sauce on the side. 
4 boneless chicken breast halves with skin on, washed and patted dry 

2 cloves garlic, peeled, crushed 

1 teaspoon herbs de provence or herb mix of basil, thyme and oregano 

1/2 teaspoon black pepper 

1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 

1 tablespoon olive oil 

1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 

Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 

Roasted Pepper and Basil Salsa, optional, (recipe follows) 

Make 3 slashes in the skin only of the chicken breasts; set them aside. 

In a bowl large enough to hold the chicken breasts, whisk together the garlic, herbs de provence, pepper, Dijon mustard, oil and vinegar. 

Add the chicken and turn to coat it evenly. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes to 2 hours, turning at least once. 

Just before grilling, preheat or prepare the grill to medium-high. Lightly oil the grill grate. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Grill the chicken, skin side down, 7 minutes or until crisp. Turn and continue grilling until the chicken is thoroughly cooked, about 5 minutes more. 

Remove the chicken from the grill and serve hot with Roasted Pepper and Basil Salsa.
