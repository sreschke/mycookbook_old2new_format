- « cup kosher salt 
- 4 cups water 
- 4 boneless pork loin chops, about ?-inch thick 
- 3 tablespoons flour 
- 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
- About 2 tablespoons olive oil

- « cup water 
- 2 teaspoons Lapsang Souchong tea leaves (2 tea bags) 
- « ounce dried porcini mushrooms 
- « cup rich chicken broth, heated 
- 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons apricot preserves 
- 1 medium clove garlic, peeled and minced 
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
- ¬ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
- 1 tablespoon coarsely chopped Italian parsley 

1. To prepare chops: Combine salt and water in a large bowl; stirring to dissolve the salt. (Kosher salt dissolves more quickly than table salt.) Add chops to the brine. Place a small plate right on top of the pork to keep them submerged. Refrigerate 2 hours or longer. 

2. Begin preparation for the sauce: Bring « cup water to a boil. Pour over tea leaves and let steep 5 minutes. Rinse dried mushrooms briefly to flush away dirt and put into a bowl. Strain tea over mushrooms; stir in hot chicken broth. Set aside 25 minutes, or until mushrooms have softened. Strain, reserving mushrooms and broth separately. 

3. Whisk apricot preserves into the mushroom broth and set aside. Squeeze excess moisture out of mushrooms, chop coarsely and set aside with garlic. 

4. Drain pork chops. Place on a plate lined with several paper towels, top with more paper towels and pat lightly to absorb excess moisture. Heat a heavy 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge pork in flour and sprinkle with pepper. Add 1 tablespoon oil to pan and heat. Put 2 to 4 chops into pan and cook without moving 4 minutes. Turn and cook 4 minutes longer, or until cooked through. Remove chops to a warm oven. If all of chops didn't fit in the pan, repeat with remaining oil and chops. Transfer to the oven. 

5. Put mushrooms and garlic into pan, stirring 30 seconds. Deglaze pan with mushroom liquid mixture, stirring to loosen browned juices on bottom. Cook at a high simmer 3 to 4 minutes. Pour any juices that have accumulated around pork into pan with lemon juice. Continue to simmer 2 minutes, or until lightly thickened. Season with pepper and pour over chops. Dust with parsley and serve.
