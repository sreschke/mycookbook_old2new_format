                              3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
                              1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt (or 1 teaspoon regular table salt)
                              1 teaspoon baking soda
                              1/4 teaspoon baking powder
                              3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
                              1 cup packed dark brown sugar
                              1/2 cup white sugar
                              1 tablespoon vanilla extract
                              2 large eggs
                              2 tablespoons dark corn syrup
                              1 tablespoon light cream or whole milk
                              2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
                              1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped toasted walnuts or pecans
                         
                         
                         Directions: 
                        
                         1
                              Position oven rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). (Using an
                              oven thermometer will ensure proper baking temperature since ovens vary.) Line cushion-type baking
                              sheets with baking parchment; set aside. (Professional bakeries double their baking sheets and use
                              baking parchment.) 
                        
                         2
                              In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder; set aside. In a large
                              mixer bowl, cream together butter, sugars and vanilla at medium speed until creamy and light. Add
                              eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in corn syrup and cream or milk. Reduce
                              mixer speed to low. Add flour mixture, in 3 separate batches, scraping down bowl after each addition.
                              Mix well to ensure full incorporation of flour mixture. Stir in chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate)
                              and nuts. 
                        
                         3
                              For each cookie, using a 1- 3/8 inch spring-loaded scoop (or 1 tablespoon measuring spoon), scoop
                              2 level spoonfuls of dough and roll into a ball with wet hands. (Dough will be very sticky. Wetting
                              hands between every 3 rollings of dough will prevent sticking. Simply hold hands under running tap
                              water and shake hands 10 times over sink before handling dough. Don't worry, this will not harm the
                              cookies. I guarantee that this added effort will be worth it for these cookies!) Arrange at least 2 inches
                              apart on prepared baking sheets. (Cookies will spread a bit during baking.) Flatten each ball of dough
                              slightly with heel of hand or fingers.

                              Bake for 14 minutes or until light golden brown around edges and centers are still a little puffy. (Do
                              not underbake this particular cookie or they will be too soft.) Allow cookies to cool at least 5 minutes
                              while on baking sheets before transferring (with a thin, metal cookie spatula) to wire racks to cool
                              completely. Repeat with remaining dough and fresh sheets of baking parchment. Store cookies in an
                              airtight container at room temperature. (These chewy chocolate chip cookies keep better than
                              traditional types.)
