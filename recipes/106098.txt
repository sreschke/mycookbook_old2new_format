MMMMM-----------------------NOW, YOU NEED----------------------------
      6    (4-oz.) cubed steaks 
  It is a "minute" or "cube" steak (steaks bought in a store already
  "tenderized") or round steak pounded out thin, breaded and fried in
  hot oil so it develops a crust like typical fried chicken.  The steak
  should be around 1/4 inch thick.  It's served topped with a white
  cream (or milk) gravy.  
  Dip steaks in buttermilk mixture, dredge in flour mixture.  Let stand
  for 10 minutes on paper towels.  Fry steaks in 1/4" vegetable oil in
  a heavy skillet at medium high heat (375F) until browned, adding oil
  as necessary. Remove steaks and drain on paper towels.  
  Pour off pan drippings, reserving 3 Tb. drippings.  Add 1/4 cup of
  flour; stir over medium heat until bubbly.  Boil 1 minute, stirring
  constantly. Add 2 cups milk; cook until thickened, stirring
  constantly. Stir in 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper.  Add steaks to
  gravy.  Cover and simmer for 5 minutes.
