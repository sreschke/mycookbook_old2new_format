If it is still to thick, add one or two tbsp water.  Transfer to a bowl.  Season to taste with salt and Aleppo pepper or cayenne, adding enough to make the mixture taste hot.  Serve at room temperture.  Serves 4.

This is a delicious appetizer that requires little effort and few ingredients.  All you need to do is whirl the ingredients in a food processor until they reach the desired texture.  Leave the mixture chunky and eat it with a fork like a salad, or use more olive oil and blend it until smooth for spreading on wedges of fresh pita.  If you like, drizzle a little more olive oil over the dip at serving time.  Mahammara also makes a delicious sauce for grilled fish, roast chicken, or kebabs.
