      Basic Muffin Mix
      Makes 11 cups  
            Amount Ingredient 
	    8 cups flour (again, if you prefer whole wheat, use whole
wheat pastry flour) 
	    3 cups sugar (can use sucanat if you prefer, see note on
pancake mix) 
            3 tablespoons baking powder 
            2 teaspoons salt 
            2 teaspoons cinnamon 
            2 teaspoons nutmeg 
     
      Combine everything in a large bowl and divide into freezer
zipper topped bags. Mark date with a Sharpie pen and store in the
freezer or cool dry place.

      To make muffins:
      Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

      In a bowl, mix together 3 cups baking mix, 3 tablespoons
vegetable oil, 2 eggs, 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup berries, raisins,
chocolate chips or whatever else you'd like.

      Bake in a prepared muffin pan-that means lightly greased (I
prefer the cupcake papers-easy clean up!), filling cups 2/3 full.
Bake for 20 minutes or until nicely browned. Cool for five minutes in
the pan then turn out on to a rack to cool. Makes about 12 muffins,
depending on the size of your muffin tin.
