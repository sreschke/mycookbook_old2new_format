Combine flour, cocoa, sugar, Splenda, baking soda, and salt and mix well.  Stir in applesauce, egg whites, and vanilla.  Spray an 8" square baking pan with cooking spray.  Spread batter evenly in the pan.  Bake at 350 for 20 min, or until edges are firm and the center is almost set.  These are cake brownies.  They are very sweet, so you might want to cut down the amount sugar and splenda.  I cut these into 8 servings and they were 2 points per serving.
