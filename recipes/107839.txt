These are the best...you can make a ton of balls, and form them and freeze them until needed. No messy frying,,just put them on a cooking sheet, and throw them in the oven. These are the balls that i use for sweet and sour meatballs, meatball stroganoff, hamburger soup, or spaghetti and meatballs. Great flavor.

 
1 lb. extra lean ground beef
1 medium onion, chopped very fine
OR
1 pkg. dry onion soup mix
1 tsp. beef oxo (only if you aren't using onion soup mix)
1 tbsp. prepared mustard
1 egg
1/4 cup. breadcrumbs, or 6 soda crackers, or 1/4 cup oats

Combine these ingredients well, adding more breadcrumbs if too moist. Roll into balls, and place on a baking sheet. Place into 350 degree oven for about 25 minutes or until meatballs are done.
