Serves 6

3 large red bell peppers
salt
pepper
2-1/2 ounces cooked ham in 3 slices
4-1/2 ounces imported Italian fontina in 6 slices
3 tablespoons olive oil

Set peppers on outdoor grill, under broiler, or directly on a gas burner. Watch them closely and when the skin blackens turn the peppers with tongs
until the entire surface is black.  Place in a brown paper bag and close. 

After the peppers have cooled, scrape away the blackened skin with a paring knife.  Cut the peppers in half, remove the seed and membrane.  Lay the pepper halves out on a board, skinned side down.  Lightly salt and pepper the insides.  Put half a slice of ham and a slice of fontina on each pepper.  Fold in half and secure with a toothpick.  Oil a shallow baking dish with 1/2 tablespoon of the oil.  Set the peppers in the dish and drizzle the rest of the oil on top.  Put them into a preheated 400 degree oven and bake until the fontina melts, about 10 minutes.  Let cool briefly and remove toothpicks before serving.
