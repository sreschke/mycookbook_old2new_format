Warm Chocolate Molton Cake
1.5 c (?#) butter
12 oz. chocolate, bittersweet
6 eggs, whole
6 egg yolks
1 Â¬ c. sugar
6 tsp. flour, all purpose 

PROCEDURE:
Melt butter and chocolate together over a double boiler (steaming water). In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg product with the sugar and flour until fully incorporated. Cool the chocolate and butter slightly and whisk into egg mixture. Ready 10 6-ounce molds by rubbing inside with a cold stick of butter, then adding a little flour to coat. Shake out excess flour. This step will keep the finished cake from sticking. 

Place molded cakes on a sheet tray and cook in 450-degree preheated convention oven for 6 to 7 minutes.  

Have vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, berries and/or caramel sauce ready.
