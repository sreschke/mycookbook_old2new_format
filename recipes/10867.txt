Cover 4 to 6 smoked turkey legs with 3 quarts of water - Bring to a boil - Reduce heat and cook for about 1 1/2 hours.  Remove meat from liquid and set aside - add 4 Knorrs bouillion cubes.
Meanwhile - In 1/4 cup butter, saute 1/2 cup each of carrots, onion, celery.  Add to this 1/4 cup flour and 1 1/2 Tablespoons cornstarch.(This will be almost paste like.)  Put vegetables in HOT broth.  (Note - flour mixture will dissolve)  Add to broth  l quart of half & half and l quart of milk. 
(Note - all liquids should be equal ratio)
Cut Velvetta cheese (large Block) into chunks.  Add to liquid, STIRRING CONSTANTLY  !  After it is dissolved, add turkey.  Add 1/8 teaspoon soda - stir.  HINT - I use Fajita seasoning rather than salt and pepper, and I usually add small block Velvetta Mexican cheese.

THIS SOUP WILL BURN EASILY.  
Suggestion is to warm VERY slowly or heat by cup in micro-wave.
