Grandpa's Chocolate-Rum Cake 
From Oxmoor House 
 

Dark chocolate and rum are the predominant flavors in this dense and decadent cake. Because the flavors are so intense, you need only a thin slice to be perfectly satisfied. The cake slices well after chilling 1 hour, but plan to refrigerate it overnight before serving to allow the flavors to mellow.
