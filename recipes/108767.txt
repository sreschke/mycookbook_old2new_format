This salad uses a variety of winter fruit to wake up even the most jaded palate. The dish can be made several hours ahead of time, but don?t dress the salad until just before you?re ready to serve it.

For the Vinaigrette 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2-1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil
2 to 3 tablespoons dried cranberries, left whole or coarsely chopped
For the Salad 
1 large Bosc pear, peeled or unpeeled
1-1/2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup pine nuts, unsalted cashews, slivered almonds, or walnut halves
1/2 pound baby arugula, baby spinach, or watercress (about 6 packed cups), larger stems removed
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
1. To make the vinaigrette: Mix the salt, pepper, and vinegar in a small bowl. Whisk in the oil to make a smooth mixture. Gently stir in the cranberries and set aside. (The vinaigrette can be made several hours ahead of time; cover and refrigerate.)

2. To make the salad: Cut the pear into 8 wedges, removing the core. In a large skillet, heat the oil and butter over medium heat. Add the pear wedges, flesh side down, and saut‚ for 4 minutes. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Gently flip the pear wedges over and cook for another 4 minutes on the other side; the pears will turn a golden brown and should be just tender. Remove and drain on a paper towel.

3. Meanwhile, heat the oil and butter remaining in the pan over medium-low heat. Add the nuts and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring, until they are golden brown. Remove from the heat.

4. Put the greens in the bottom of a salad bowl or on a medium-size serving platter. Arrange the pears around the outside of the greens. Sprinkle the salad with the blue cheese and saut‚ed nuts. (The salad is best served while the pears and nuts are still a bit warm, but you can make everything ahead of time up to this point.) Drizzle the vinaigrette over the salad just before serving. 

LYNNE'S TIPS 
For a main course salad, double the ingredients to serve 4, or use the quantity given in the recipe for 2 servings. Add some good bread and you have supper. A little ice cream for dessert wouldn?t hurt.

Try dried tart cherries or blueberries instead of cranberries.

Sweet-tart bosc pears are the ones to choose for saut‚ing, baking or poaching as they hold their shape when cooked. Brown skinned and long, find them in supermarkets from October to April.

Pears ripen from the inside out. You can tell if a pear is ripe by pressing gently on the area right next to the stem. If it gives, the pear is ripe.

There are some decent cow?s milk American blue cheeses available in supermarkets. They come in wedges or crumbled. For a splurge, go for Danish Blue, French Roquefort, or domestic Maytag Blue from Iowa.
