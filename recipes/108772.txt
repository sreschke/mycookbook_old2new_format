You'll draw a standing ovation at your Christmas dinner with this standing rib roast, especially when you serve it with my favorite green peppercorn and port wine sauce. Green and black peppercorns differ only in when they're harvested. The green ones have a subtler flavor because they're plucked before they mature.
  
 Ingredients 
1 fully trimmed 6-rib roast (about 12 lbs.)

Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper 
4 shallots, finely chopped

1 cup port wine 
1 can (14-1/2 oz.) reduced-sodium beef broth 
1 can (14-1/2 oz.) reduced-sodium chicken broth 
2 Tbsp. green peppercorns, drained 
1/4 cup all-purpose flour 
Yield: Serves12

  Directions 
1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees and position rack in middle of oven.


2. Place roasting rack in large roasting pan.


3. Sprinkle roast with 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Place roast in pan, fat side up, and roast 30 minutes. Then baste every 30 minutes or until roast reaches internal temperature of 120 degrees at large end for rare (about 2 hours), 125 to 130 degrees for medium rare (about 2-1/4 hours), 140 degrees for medium (about 2-3/4 hours).


4. Transfer to carving board and let roast rest 20 minutes. Remove strings.


5. Meanwhile, remove rack and most fat from roasting pan.


6. Place over medium-high heat and add shallots. Cook, scraping browned bits from bottom of pan, about 2 minutes.


7. Whisk in flour, a little at a time to prevent lumps. Whisk in port and bring to boil. Add both broths and simmer until nicely thickened, about 15 minutes. Stir in green peppercorns and season with salt and pepper.
