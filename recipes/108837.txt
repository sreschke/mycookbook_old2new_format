smothered pork chops 
Category: Pork
Preparation Level: difficult

1 cup all-purpose flour 
2 tablespoons onion powder 
2 tablespoons garlic powder 
1 teaspoon cayenne 
1 teaspoon salt 
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
4 pork chops, 3/4-inch thick, bone-in 
1/4 cup olive oil 
1 cup chicken broth 
1/2 cup buttermilk 
Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish 


Put the flour in a shallow platter and add the onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper; mix with a fork to distribute evenly. Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels to remove any moisture and then dredge them in the seasoned flour; shaking off the excess. 
Heat a large saute pan or cast iron skillet over medium heat and coat with the oil. When the oil is nice and hot, lay the pork chops in the pan in a single layer and fry for 3 minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove the pork chops from the pan and add a little sprinkle of seasoned flour to the pan drippings. Mix the flour into the fat to dissolve and then pour in the chicken broth in. Let the liquid cook down for 5 minutes to reduce and thicken slightly. Stir in the buttermilk to make a creamy gravy and return the pork chops to the pan, covering them with the sauce. Simmer for 5 minutes until the pork is cooked through. Season with salt and pepper and garnish with chopped parsley before serving.
