One of the luxuries of summertime is that we can grill almost anytime the urge strikes; but if the elements are uncooperative, there are still ways to give your food the distinctive grilled taste. One idea is to use a grill pan, which works especially well with vegetables. Heat the pan until it is very hot but not smoking. This recipe is also adaptable to an outdoor grill.   
 
GRILLED VEGETABLES
Serves 6 
 
  3 baby eggplants, halved lengthwise
2 yellow squashes, cut on an angle into 1/3-inch-thick slices
18 medium scallions, white and light-green parts only, cut on an angle into 3-inch pieces
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper  
 
 1. Heat a grill pan or an outdoor grill. Place eggplants, yellow squashes, and scallions in large bowl. Add olive oil, and toss to combine. Place vegetables on grill pan. Grill until lightly charred on one side, about 4 minutes. Turn the vegetables, and cook until lightly charred and tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, about 4 minutes more. 

2. As the vegetables are cooked, return to bowl; add balsamic vinegar, thyme, salt, and pepper. Toss to combine. Taste, and adjust for seasoning. Serve immediately.
