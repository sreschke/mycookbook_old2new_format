2 Cups whole wheat flour (bread flour, not pastry flour)
2 tsp. baking powder
2 Tbs. apple sauce
1 Tbs. light unsulphured molasses (or bee vomit)
1 Cup low fat soy milk (I use Edensoy vanilla, which is about 18% fat)
1 Cup apple juice
Directions:
Add all ingredients in the order given and then mix. Cook however you cook pancakes and waffles (I have not been able to get by without a cooking spray for waffles). I make my pancakes big (coaster sized) and put in fresh fruit when I have it handy. I pour my pancake and add the fruit to the cake on the griddle. Oh, yeah--top with real maple syrup.
