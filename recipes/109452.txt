
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted margarine, at room temperature
1 /3 to 1 /2 cup sugar
1 extra-large egg
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
1 /4 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
3 /4 cup sifted cake flour

   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.

  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the margarine together with the sugar on low speed until fluffy. Scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula, then beat in the egg and vanilla until incorporated. Stir in the orange and lemon zests.

   Still on low speed, beat in the flour until fluffy blended.

   By teaspoonfuls, drop the batter onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving a good 2 inches between each. Bake the cookies, rotating sheets halfway through the baking time, for a total of about 7 minutes, or until the wafers are lightly browned around the edges. With a metal spatula, transfer the wafers to cooling racks, where they crisp as they cool. Store carefully, in layers, in an airtight container for up to a week.

    Makes about 4 dozen two-inch wafers.
