
Mixing the cornmeal with cold water insures lump-free polenta. If you want to make the polenta ahead of time it can be kept over barely simmering
water for a few hours prior to serving.

Polenta:
1-1/2 quarts water 
2 teaspoons salt
1-1/2 cups instant polenta (available at specialty stores) or yellow corn meal
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
few grindings of nutmeg
freshly grated Parmesan cheese

In a heavy 3 to 4 quart saucepan bring 1 quart water and salt to a boil.  Mix the polenta or cornmeal with remaining 1/2 quart water. Add the
cornmeal mixture, stirring well, to the boiling water.  Continue stirring over medium-low heat to keep the mixture smooth. Simmer 5 to 6 minutes for
instant polenta or 20 to 30 minutes for cornmeal, stirring frequently. 

Polenta will become very thick while cooking.  It is done when it comes away cleanly from sides of saucepan. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
Dish into soup plates and top with tomato and corn sauce. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Serves 6.

Tomato and Corn Sauce:

2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped parsley
2 tablespoons fresh oregano or 2 teaspoons dried oregano
10 plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped
1 cup fresh corn removed from the cob
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Heat olive oil in a medium-size skillet and saute onions, parsley, and oregano for 5 minutes, or until onions are soft.  Add remaining ingredients.  Cook 10 to 15 minutes.
