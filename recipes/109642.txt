My friend Judy Gordon serves these for Sunday brunch. The recipe can be easily doubled.

2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 package (6) frozen blintzes
3 eggs
1/4 cup orange juice
1/2 cup sour cream
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar mixed with 2 teaspoons cinnamon
2 cups fresh blueberries, strawberries, raspberries (one type or a mixture)
1/2 cup sour cream

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place butter in a small baking dish (one that will hold the blintzes snugly) and set it in the oven until melted. Roll
the frozen blintzes in the butter.  Arrange the blintzes in a single layer in the baking dish. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs well.  Add the sour
cream, sugar, orange juice, vanilla and salt and whisk until smooth.  Pour the mixture over the blintzes.  Sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar mixture and
bake until set for about 40 minutes. To serve, cut into squares.  Sprinkle each portion with berries and a spoon of sour cream.  Serves 4.
