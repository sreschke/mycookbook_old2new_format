Makes 4 sandwiches 


2 eggs 
1/4 teaspoon pepper 
1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves 
1/2 pound Monterey Jack cheese, sliced or shredded (2 cups) 
2 tablespoons chopped jalapeno peppers (see note) 
8 slices firm, chewy bread 
1 cup chunky salsa 

In a shallow dish, lightly beat the egg substitute with the pepper. If using 2 eggs, beat in 1 to 2 tablespoons water. Stir in the cilantro. Make 4 sandwiches by layering the cheese and peppers between the slices of bread. Heat a large nonstick skillet. Dip the sandwiches in the egg mixture, turning to coat both sides of the bread. Cook over medium heat, in two batches if necessary, turning once, until both sides are crusty and golden brown and the cheese is melted, 5 to 8 minutes total. Cut each sandwich in half and serve topped with the salsa. Note: If you use full-fat jalapeno pepper jack cheese, you can omit added jalapenos.
