This tempura-like batter ensures a delicate crisp coating.

3 large onions, cut crosswise 
1 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 teaspoon baking soda
1-1/2 cups ice water
1/2 teaspoon salt
Vegetable oil for frying

Separate the onion into rings.  Soak in a bowl of ice water for about 2 hours.  Combine the flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt in a large
bowl.  Add 1-1/2 cups of ice water all at once and whisk until the batter is smooth.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before using. Pour 2 inches of oil into a heavy, medium saucepan or deep fryer.  Heat
until 375 degrees on deep fat thermometer.  Place all of the onions in the batter and stir to coat.  Work in batches to prevent crowding.  Drop the
onion rings, one by one, into the hot oil.  Fry for 3 to 4 minutes, turning once, until crisp and golden.  Drain well on paper towels.  Sprinkle with
salt and serve at once. 4 to 6 servings.
