From MMMMiami--Tempting Tropical Tastes for Home Cooks Everywhere by Carole Kotkin and Kathy Martin

This recipe comes from "A Celebration of the Seasons" by Steven Raichlen (Poseidon Press, $18.95).  Red bell peppers can be used if yellow are
either too expensive or unavailable. I like to serve it on a bed of lettuce.

2 large yellow bell peppers 
1 pound slender green beans
salt

Herb Vinaigrette:
1 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1/8 teaspoon salt
fresh black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs (dill, tarragon, oregano, and/or basil)
3 to 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

Core and seed the peppers, and cut each one lengthwise into 1/4" strips. Snap the ends off the beans and remove any strings.  Blance the pepper
strips in rapidly boiling salted water for 15 seconds, then transfer them with a slotted spoon to a strainer and refresh under cold water.  Cook the
green beans in rapidly boiling salted water for 2 to 3 minutes, or until crispy-tender.  Refresh under cold water and drain. Prepare the vinaigrette.  Place the mustard, vinegar, salt, pepper, and herbs in the bottom of a salad bowl, and whisk them into a smooth paste.  Gradually
whisk in the oil--the sauce should thicken.  Add the beans and peppers and
toss to mix.  Serves 4.
