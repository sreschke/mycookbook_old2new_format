The Mayan word for this mixture (xnipec) means "nose of the dog," a vivid description of its sinus-clearing effects. For a truly incendiary salsa, add an extra habanero.

16	medium tomatillos (about 2 pounds), husked, rinsed
1/2	medium white onion
4	garlic cloves, peeled
1	1 1/2-inch-long fresh habanero chile

1/2	cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 1/2	tablespoons fresh lime juice
1	teaspoon salt 

Preheat broiler. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil. Arrange tomatillos, onion, garlic, and chile on prepared baking sheet. Broil until vegetables blacken in spots, about 5 minutes per side for chile and about 10 minutes per side for tomatillos, onion, and garlic.

Transfer vegetables and any accumulated juices to blender. Add cilantro, lime juice, and salt. Puree until smooth. Transfer salsa to bowl. Cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. Season salsa to taste with more salt.
