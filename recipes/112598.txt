Chicken Francais* (Chicken French)

6 oz (170 g) chicken breast
flour
1 egg, beaten
1/2 - 1 fl oz (15 - 30 mL) clarified butter
lemon wedges
1/4 C (60 mL) sherry
salt + pepper
freshly chopped parsley
1 T (15 mL) whole butter

Pound the chicken breasts between plastic wrap until they are a
uniform 1/4" (10 mm) thick.  (If necessary, you can butterfly the
chicken first.) Lightly coat the chicken with flour, then into the egg
wash.  Heat a saute pan until a drop of water dances, THEN add the
clarified butter.  Coat the pan evenly.  Add the chicken to the pan,
being careful not to splatter the butter.  Give the pan a few shakes
to make sure the chicken's not sticking, then leave it alone (you may
need to reduce the heat a bit).  Cook until you see the edges of the
chicken start to whiten, and flip it over.  Count to 30, then squeeze
the lemon over the chicken and add the sherry.  (Flambe is optional -
just make sure you're prepared.) Reduce heat to LOW, add the whole
butter, season and garnish.  Once the butter melts, it's ready to
serve.  Goes well with fava beans and a nice Chianti.
