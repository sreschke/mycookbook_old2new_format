In a large soup pot, saute carrots, onion, celery, garlic, poblanos, salt, pepper, cumin and thyme until vegetables are crisp-tender. 
Add stock, cilantro and chicken and cook several minutes more. 
In a saucepan, melt butter and add flour. 
Cook flour, stirring, for 2-3 minutes, over low heat, but do not brown like a roux. 
Add a cup of the soup to the flour and whisk briskly, then add two more, one at a time, whisking briskly after each addition. 
Pour the mixture into the soup pot and stir, cooking and stirring the soup constantly until the soup thickens, about 3-5 minutes more. 
Blend in the cream and hot sauce, remove from heat, and serve.
