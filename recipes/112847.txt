How to make chocolate shavings:

Start with a large block or bar of good quality chocolate. (White and milk chocolate are softest and curl most easily.) Hold the chocolate with a paper towel and using a vegetable peeler shave the narrowest side of the block. The chocolate will curl best if the room or the bar is slightly warm. Keep refrigerated in a covered container until needed.
