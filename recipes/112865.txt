1 Stick margerine
1 cup pretzels crushed (I use small pretzels)
3 Tbl sugar
1 cup pecans chopped
8 oz cream cheese
8 oz cool whip
1 cup powdered sugar
6 oz strawberry jello
2 cups boiling water
16 oz frozen strawberries

Melt butter in 9X13 glass pan.  Combine next 3 ingredients. (I put the pretzels in a large zip lock and crush with a rolling pin, then add the nuts and sugar and shake).  Pat into pan and bake the crust for 8-10 mins at 350. Beat cool whip, cream cheese and powdered sugar with mixer until smooth.  After crust cools spread the cream cheese mixture over top. Place in refrigerator for 30 mins.  While cooling, mix jello and boiling water until dissolved, then add thawed strawberries.  Pour this over the cream cheese mixture and chill for at least 4 hours.
