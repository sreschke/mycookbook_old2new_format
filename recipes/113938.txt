This is easy to make and I almost always have all the ingredients on hand.

1 sleeve saltine crackers
2 sticks unsalted butter
1 c sugar
12 ozs chocolate chips
toasted, chopped almonds or pecans (optional)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line bottom and up the sides of an 11 x 16 jelly roll pan with foil. Arrange crackers to cover bottom of pan in a single layer. You may have 1 or 2 crackers left over or may need to change direction of a few crackers to make them fit.
Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar and stir constantly with a wire whisk for 3 minutes. Do not let mixture brown.
Pour mixture over the saltine crackers and spread out evenly. Bake 12 mins. until lightly browned around the edges. Watch carefully because it will turn too brown quickly.
Remove from oven and immediately top with chocolate chips. Let stand until chips melt and then spread chocolate evenly over base. Top with nuts if desired. Let sit overnight until chocolate hardens or put in refrigerator to set quicker. Cut into pieces with sharp knife and keep in airtight container.
