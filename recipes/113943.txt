2 ¬ cups whole milk 
Pinch cinnamon 
About 20 amaretti cookies, crushed into small pieces and crumbs.

Check after about 30 minutes; when it begins to get icy, use the back of a large spoon to press down on the mixture and break it into pieces. Repeat several times over the next 2 hours, until the granita is fully frozen but broken into shards. To serve, place 1 « tablespoons crushed amaretti cookies in the bottom of a glass, followed by a serving of granita, and top with 2 more tablespoons crushed cookies. Serves 8.
