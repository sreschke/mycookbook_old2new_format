2 cucumbers
2 Vidalia onions
Salt
2 to 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon cider vinegar

Peel cucumbers and slice in thin circles. Halve the onions and slice 
thin. Layer both the cucumbers and onions in a shallow dish, 
sprinkling each layer with salt. Let stand covered, in refrigerator 
overnight to draw out the moisture.

In the morning, drain the cucumbers and onions and rinse. Let dry on 
plain white paper towels. Beat together the mayonnaise, sugar and 
vinegar until creamy. Gently stir into mixed cucumbers and onions. 
The dressing should be plentiful so the salad is creamy.

Chill before serving.
