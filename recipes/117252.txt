Place 1 sage leaf and 1 slice of ham on 1 side of each of the veal cutlets, and secure with a toothpick. In a 12 to 14-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons butter over high heat until it foams and subsides. Season each cutlet with salt and pepper and pan-fry 2 minutes on each side. Remove and keep warm. Keeping the pan hot, pour the wine into the pan and stir with a wooden spoon to dislodge the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, season with salt and pepper, and return the cooked cutlets to the pan to reheat. Serve immediately.
