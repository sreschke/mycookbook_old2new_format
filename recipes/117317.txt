Pineapple Upside-Down Cake

On Maui they use fresh, locally grown pineapple for this ever-popular dessert.

1/3 cup butter, melted
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
2 cups fresh pineapple, cut into 1/2-inch chunks
11/2 cups all-purpose flour
11/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup butter, softened
2/3 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
3/4 cup milk

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Drain the pineapple chunks, and pat until very dry using paper towels. (We made this recipe with fresh pineapple both on Maui and at home with pineapple from a North Hills supermarket; the Maui pineapple was much juicier. Both cakes were delicious, though.) Mix butter and sugar together, and put into a 9-inch--by-2-inch-deep square cake pan. Arrange the pineapple on top.

Sift together flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Set aside. In a separate bowl, beat the butter with the sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture, alternating with the milk, ending with the flour mix. Pour batter into pan, and bake in the middle of the oven for 45 to 55 minutes. Let rest for 15 minutes, and then turn out onto a serving plate. Serve warm with whipped cream.
