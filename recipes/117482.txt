3 large onions
1/2 ounce fresh ginger
1/2 ounce garlic
2 small tomatoes, skinned and seeded
2 black cardamoms
8 cloves
2 cinnamon or bay leaves
15 peppercorns
1 teaspoon cumin seeds

Pinch asafoetida (antiflatulent with pungent aroma)
1/3 cup oil
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper pepper
3/4 teaspoon dried mango powder (amchoor)

If using dried chickpeas, soak overnight in 5 cups of
water. Chop 2 of the onions and reserve. In a food
processor, puree another onion with the ginger and
garlic. Puree the tomatoes separately.
Place chickpeas and soaking water in a large saucepan
or Dutch oven with half the chopped onion, the black
cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon or bay leaves,
peppercorns, cumin seeds, 1 teaspoon salt, and the
asafoetida. Bring to a boil. Cook for at least 50
minutes at a low, rolling boil, until chickpeas are
tender but still have their shape. Drain and reserve
cooking liquid.
In a separate cooking pot, heat the oil. Add rest of
the chopped onion and saute for 25 minutes, or until
deep brown. Add the pureed onion, ginger and garlic
mixture and saute for 10 minutes.
Add turmeric, garam masala and coriander powders,
pepper and mango powder and stir thoroughly. After 1
minute, add pureed tomato and saute for a few minutes.

Add cooked chickpeas and stir gently. Add water in
which the chickpeas were cooked (you can strain away
the spices since their flavor is already extracted)
and cook until tender. Add salt to taste at the end of
cooking.
