12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 
1/4 cup Vadouvan Exotique spice mix 
1/4 cup red-grapefruit juice 
1 pinch sea salt or fleur de sel 
1/3 cup kosher salt 
2 tablespoons white-wine vinegar 
1 pound head-on large gulf shrimp or 9 ounces head-off (12 to 15 count per pound)
1 red grapefruit, peeled and segmented, optional. 

1. In a large pot, bring 1 gallon of water to a boil over high heat. In a large skillet, melt 8 tablespoons of butter over medium heat until the butter starts to separate. Add the Vadouvan Exotique and brown the butter over low heat until it begins to smell nutty, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool until lukewarm, then mix in the remaining butter until incorporated. Stir in the grapefruit juice and season with sea salt. 

2. Season the boiling water with the kosher salt and vinegar. Add the shrimp, cover with a lid and turn off the heat. Poach for 4 minutes, then drain. When cool enough to handle, peel the shrimp, leaving the heads on, and devein. 

3. Toss the shrimp in the spiced butter. Serve with the remaining sauce and, if you choose, grapefruit segments. Serves 4 as an appetizer. Adapted from David Kinch at Manresa.
