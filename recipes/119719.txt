Dip chicken into 1/2 cup buttermilk, then roll in flour seasoned with salt and pepper.  Melt butter in a 13x9x2 pan.  Put chicken in pan, skin side down, and bake uncovered at 425 F for 30 minutes.  Turn chicken and bake another 15 minutes.  Blend remaining 1 cup buttermilk & soup (plus 1 can of water) and pour around chicken.  Bake 15 minutes more.
