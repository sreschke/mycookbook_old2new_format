1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet. Add onion, cook over low heat until wilted. Add sausage and cook, stirring, until it loses redness. Add radicchio and cook, stirring, until wilted, about 6 minutes. Stir in fennel seeds and 1 tablespoon vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.
