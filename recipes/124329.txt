1 cup + 2 Tbsp warm water
1 tsp salt
1« tsp sugar
1 Tbsp oil
3 cups bread flour
2 Tbsp wheat gluten
1¬ tsp dry yeast

Place all ingredients in bread machine and process in "dough" setting. When done, place dough on floured surface and divide into 8 equal size balls.  Cover balls and let rest 10 minutes. Roll each piece into a 6" round circle. (I put 3 each on the large cookie sheet and 2 on a smaller one) Let rise for 30 minutes. Turn oven to 500ø.

Place 2 each on 2 wire cake racks. Place both racks  directly on oven rack. Bake for 4-5 minutes until puffed and golden. To remove pitas from oven, I use a pancake turner and push them onto a cookie sheet.
It's difficult to pick up the cookie racks from the oven with the puffs on them.

Immediately place a damp cloth over the baked pitas until soft.  Once softened, pitas may be split and filled. Store in refrigerator or may be frozen   .
