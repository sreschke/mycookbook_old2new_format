1. In a medium saucepan, combine water, cardamom, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, coriander and peppercorns; bring to a boil. Stir in tea leaves, reduce heat to low, cover and barely simmer for 10 minutes. Strain, cool at room temperature, then chill in refrigerator.

Times Kitchen Note: Because the spiced tea is going to be strained, the fresh ginger doesn't need to be peeled. But wash well to remove any grit before slicing and chopping the ginger.
