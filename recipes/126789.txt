If you can find baby Chioggia beets and nectarines at the same time, this is a sublime dish. Chef Jeremy Fox likes it served warm.

Ingredients

20 baby Chioggia beets, washed
2 nectarines
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
8 ounces fresh squeezed orange juice, or as needed
4 ounces water, or as needed
4 to 6 sprigs fresh marjoram, leaves stripped and stems reserved
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon Champagne vinegar
Sea salt and black pepper to taste
Marjoram leaves, for garnish

Instructions: 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees

In an 8- by 8-inch ovenproof dish, place whole beets, whole nectarines, olive oil, orange juice, water, marjoram stems and salt, making sure that the liquid goes halfway up the beets. Add more orange juice and water if necessary. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake until beets and nectarines are tender, 45 minutes to an hour.

Remove beets while still warm, saving roasting juices.
Peel beets, slice in half lengthwise and place in medium bowl, and toss with champagne vinegar. Set aside.

Discard marjoram stems. Pit nectarines. In a blender or food processor, place nectarines and roasting juices. Blend until smooth. Strain through a sieve. Place warm beets on a serving plate, top with warm nectarine puree and season with salt and pepper. Scatter with 1 teaspoon of marjoram leaves.
