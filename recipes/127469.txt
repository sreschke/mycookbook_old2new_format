1. In a medium saucepan, bring the broth and 3/4 cup water to a boil. Stir in the rice, cover and cook over low heat for 18 minutes. Fluff with a fork and spread on a baking sheet to cool.

3. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in the skillet, then add the eggs and scramble for 2 minutes. Push the eggs to the side of the pan, add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and lower the heat to medium. Add the mushrooms, red bell pepper and carrots and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the scallion, peas, garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the cooked rice and crisp it for a couple of minutes. Stir in the tamari and reserved pork.
