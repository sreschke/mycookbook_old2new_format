The Cast of Characters: New Potatoes (or other small, round potato), Olive Oil, Kosher Salt, Black Pepper, and whatever herb you like. I?m using Rosemary.

Begin by bringing a pot of salted water to a boil.

Add in as many potatoes as you wish to make, and cook them until they?re fork-tender. And yes, I realize my pot is a little full, but listen: my boys filled my large dutch oven with a combination of dog food, potting soil, and gravel yesterday, and then they placed it on top of our garage. I have to learn to make do around here.

Next, generously drizzle olive oil on a sheet pan.

When the potatoes are tender, place them on the cookie sheet?

?Giving them plenty of room to spread out.

Next, grab your potato masher and gently press down on the potato until it slightly mashes?

Then rotate the masher 90 degrees and finish flattening it. Of course, you don?t want to absolutely smash it into the pan?you want it almost to resemble a cookie.

Repeat until all are flattened. And really, I don?t know why you couldn?t use the bottom of a glass for this step if you don?t have a potato masher. The surface might not be as textured and interesting, but I think it still might work.

Next, brush the tops rather generously with olive oil.

Next, grab some Kosher salt. You can use regular salt, but I?d really recommend using kosher. It adheres to the potatoes more easily and really flavors them nicely without getting too salty.

Be ye ever as generous with fresh ground black pepper.

Now, you can grab some chives?or thyme?or whatever herbs you have available.

Whatever herb you use, just chop it pretty finely and sprinkle over the top.

Now throw them onto the top rack of a very hot (450-degree) oven, and cook them for 20-25 minutes?

?Or until they?re golden and crispy and sizzling.
