 6 Tbsp butter
* 1 pound of top sirloin or tenderloin, cut thin into 1-inch wide
by 2 1/2-inch long strips
* 1/3 cup chopped shallots (can substitute onions)
* 1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, sliced
* Salt to taste
* Pepper to taste
* 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1/2 teaspoon of dry tarragon or 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh
tarragon
* 1 cup of sour cream at room temperature

1 Melt 3 Tbsp of butter in a large skillet on medium heat. Increase
the heat to high/med-high and add the strips of beef. You want to cook
the beef quickly, browning on each side, so the temp needs to be high
enough to brown the beef, but not so high as to burn the butter. You
may need to work in batches. While cooking the beef, sprinkle with
some salt and pepper. When both sides are browned, remove the beef to
a bowl and set aside.

2 In the same pan, reduce the heat to medium and add the shallots.
Cook the shallots for a minute or two, allowing them to soak up any
meat drippings. Remove the shallots to the same bowl as the meat and
set aside.
3 In the same pan, melt another 3 Tbsp of butter. Increase heat to
medium high and add the mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally for
about 4 minutes. While cooking, sprinkle the nutmeg and the tarragon
on the mushrooms.

4 Reduce the heat to low and add the sour cream to the mushrooms. You
may want to add a tablespoon or two of water to thin the sauce (or
not). Mix in the sour cream thoroughly. Do not let it come to a simmer
or boil or the sour cream will curdle. Stir in the beef and shallots.
Add salt and pepper to taste.

Serve immediately over egg noodles, fettucine, potatoes, or rice.
(Potatoes, rice, and wheat-free pasta are wheat-free options.)

Serves 4.
