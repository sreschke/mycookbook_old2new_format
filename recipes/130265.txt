Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 medium apples, peeled and cut into thin slices
1/2 cup Smucker's? Red Plum Jam
Juice of 1/2 lemon
3 large eggs (brought to room temperature)
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon each of vanilla extract and almond extract
A "shake or two" of cinnamon
Directions:

Begin by preheating over to 350 degrees. Grease an 8 inch square 
baking pan.

Combine the flour, baking powder and salt together in a mixing bowl. 
Give dry ingredients a stir and set the bowl aside. In another bowl, 
combine apple slices, red plum jam and lemon juice. Mix up so that 
apples are coated in jam and lemon juice. Set aside.

Beat the eggs well, either with electric beater on medium, or 
vigorously by hand. Gradually add sugar and beat or mix by hand for 
two minutes or until mixture is almost fluffy. Add oil and vanilla 
and almond extracts, and continue to beat and scrape side of bowl 
until it is all combined. Next, mix in the flour mixture. Mix short 
time more until batter is blended to uniform color and consistency.

Take just half of the batter and spread evenly in the baking pan. 
Next, cover the layer of batter with the apple and jam mixture. Then 
spread the remaining half of the batter over the apples. Give a light 
shake or two of cinnamon over the surface of the cake. Bake on the 
center rack until golden (approximately 1 hour).

After removing from oven, let the cake cool. Cut into squares and 
serve.
