6 english muffins sliced in half (better if they are not the nooks and crannies type)
1 stick cheddar cheese grated (I prefer white/sharp)
1 bunch green onions (scallions)
mayo

chop green onions, add green onions and cheddar to food processor bowl and pulse until combined.  Do not over blend.  The mixture should appear green in color.  Add enough mayo to make a thick paste of cheese and onion - about 3 tablespoons.  lightly toast english muffin halves and spread each half with cheese mixture.  Do not overfill.  Cut each muffin half into quarters.  At this point, canapes may be frozen for future use.   If you want to cook them immediately, set broiler on high and broil until tops are browned and bubbly, serve immediately.  If cooking from frozen, allow to thaw slightly before broiling.
