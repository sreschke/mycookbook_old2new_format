Ingredients:


1 can (10 3/4 ounces) Campbell's? Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)
1 1/3 cups water 
3/4 cup uncooked regular long-grain white rice 
1/2 tsp. onion powder 
1/4 tsp. ground black pepper 
2 cups frozen mixed vegetables 
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts halves
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:



Heat the oven to 375Ã¸F.  Stir the soup, water, rice, onion powder, black pepper and vegetables in a 2-quart shallow baking dish. 

Top with the chicken. Season the chicken as desired. Cover the baking dish.

Bake for 50 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is tender. Top with the cheese. Let the casserole stand for 10 minutes. Stir the rice before serving.

Tip: To try it Alfredo, substitute broccoli flowerets for the vegetables and substitute 1/4 cup grated Parmesan for the Cheddar cheese. Add 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese with the soup. Sprinkle the chicken with the remaining Parmesan cheese.

Trim It Down: Use Campbell's? 98% Fat Free Cream of Chicken Soup instead of regular soup and use low fat cheese instead of regular cheese.

Mexican: In place of onion powder and pepper use 1 teaspoon chili powder. Substitute Mexican cheese blend for Cheddar.

Italian: In place of onion powder and pepper use 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, crushed. Substitute 1/3 cup shredded Parmesan for Cheddar.
