BRING a large pot of water to a boil.
ADD the oil and onion to a medium skillet, over medium heat. Saut? until the onion is browned and soft, about 25 minutes, adjust temperature to prevent burning. Place the onions on a sheet-pan and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil; allow to cool. 
ADD the smoked salmon, sun-dried tomato and Pecorino cheese, to a large bowl; season with salt and pepper, refrigerate until the pasta is finished.
COOK the Orzo 1 minute less than the package directions recommend. About 2 &#189; minutes before the Orzo is finished cooking, add the snow peas to the cooking water.
DRAIN the Orzo and snow peas, and place on the same sheet-tray as the onions to cool. Once cooled add the Orzo, onion and pea mixture to the bowl with the salmon, mix until blended well. 
ADJUST the salad's consistency with oil and re-season with salt and pepper before serving
