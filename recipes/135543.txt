PASTA WITH BROCCOLI IN ALFREDO SAUCE	 

1 lb. rotelle #124
1 stick butter
1 pt. half and half
8 oz. or more Parmesan or Romano cheese (or mixture)
1 bunch fresh broccoli (cut into florets)

Boil water for pasta in a very large pot. While pasta is cooking, heat half and half with the stick of butter in saucepan. About 3 minutes before the pasta is done, put the broccoli in the pot with the pasta (or you can cook the broccoli in the microwave for a couple of minutes right in the bag you get from the produce department).

Add the cheese to the half and half mixture; stir thoroughly. Drain pasta and broccoli well. Put back in the big pot and pour sauce over pasta. Mix thoroughly and serve immediately. Does not reheat very well, but it is absolutely delicious the first time around.
