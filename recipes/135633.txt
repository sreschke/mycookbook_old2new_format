1 cup butter 
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
1 cup chopped nuts, pecans, walnuts 
2 (16-ounce) boxes confectioners' sugar 
1/2 cup cocoa powder 
Directions
Spray lightly the bottom of a 9 by 2-inch square pan with a nonstick spray. 

In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the cheese and butter together, stirring constantly until smooth. Remove from heat and add the vanilla and nuts. 

In a large bowl sift together the sugar and cocoa. Pour the cheese mixture into the sugar and cocoa mixture and stir until completely mixed. The candy will be very stiff. 

Using your hands, remove candy from bowl and press evenly and firmly into pan. Because of the amount of butter in this recipe, pat the top of the candy with a paper towel to remove the excess oil. Place pan in refrigerator until candy is firm.
