4 boneless chicken breast halves
1/2 cup tequila
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
Fresh lime wedges

Marinate chicken in tequila and lime juice for at least 30 minutes, turn occasionally.

Prepare barbecue (med high. Drain chicken, reserve marinade. Season with salt and pepper. Grill til just cooked through, basting with reserved marinade, about 4 minutes per side. Boil the rest of the marinade in a small pan about a minute.

Cut each breast crosswise into thin slices. Arrange on a platter and garnish with lime wedges. Serve marinade as a sauce.

This can also be done in the broiler.

I like this with tomato/pepper fettucine tossed with a little oil, lime juice and cilantro.
