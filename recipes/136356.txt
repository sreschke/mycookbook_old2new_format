1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups (8 ounces) elbow macaroni
2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons flour
2 cups milk
1/2 cup cheddar cheese, grated
1/2 cup Swiss cheese, grated
1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, grated
1/2 cup seasoned Parmesan dry bread crumbs

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Grease a 1 1/2 quart deep baking dish.

Bring water and 1/2 teaspoons salt to a boil.  Add and cook macaroni until tender.  Drain.

Prepare a basic white sauce: melt 2 tablespoons of butter (low heat).  Whisk in 2 tablespoons all purpose flour and cook for about 3 minutes.  Keep whisking it.  Gradually whisk in 2 cups of milk.  Let thicken and season with salt & pepper.  This sauce will be milky because the macaroni will absorb the liquid as it cooks.

Add macaroni to baking dish; add cream sauce; stir in each 1/2 cup of cheese.  Mix thoroughly.

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter; add approx. 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs; sprinkle over macaroni in baking dish.

Bake for about 45 minutes.
