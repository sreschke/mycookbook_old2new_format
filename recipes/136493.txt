In a large bowl mix flour, sugar and salt well with a fork. Add shortening and mix with a fork until crumbly. In a small bowl, beat water, vinegar and egg. Add to flour mixture and stir until moistened. Divide dough into portions and shape each into a flat circle. Wrap each in plastic or waxed paper and chill at least 1/2 hour. Dough can be refrigerated up to 3 days, and can be frozen. To bake an empty pie shell, prick bottom and sides with a fork, fill with pie weights. Bake at 450 for 12-15 minutes.
