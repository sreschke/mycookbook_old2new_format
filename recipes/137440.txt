This recipe was given to me years ago by a woman who hailed from Tennessee.  To me, this recipe is unique.  I've been cooking and baking for over 60 years and I've not seen this recipe, or one similar to it, in any cookbook or magazine.

The pie is delicious.  I think it is Joyce's (my daughter's) favorite pie.  The flavor is deliciously "fruity" and rich, and the pie is so juicy.  There is no thickener in it.

I took the pie to a church dinner once and after the meal found the pie gone; however one lady was standing by the pie plate, running her index finger over it so she could lick her finger,  and get the very last drop of the juicy filling.

***********************************

Start with a double pie crust, either purchased or homemade.

Line a 9-inch piepan with pie crust.

Peel and slice 4, 5 or 6 cooking apples (depending on the size).

In a medium-sized saucepan combine 1/2 cup of orange juice and 1/2 cup sugar.  Heat and add the sliced apples.  Cook until the apples are tender. Remove from heat.

To the heated mixture add one stick (1/2 cup) of margarine and an additional 1/4 cup sugar.

Take one egg white and beat until frothy. Using a pastry brush, brush the crust with half the beaten egg white.  Sprinkle the brushed crust lightly with sugar.  (This seals the crust from the juices in the pie filling and keeps the crust flaky).  Pour the apple filling into the crust-lined pan.

Cut strips from the second crust and brush with the remaining egg white.  Sprinkle strips with sugar.  

Lay the strips across the pie filling, half going one way and half the other--This will leave room between the strips for the juices to evaporate while the pie is baking.  That will enable the filling to thicken.

Bake at 350 degrees on a lower rack in the oven for about 35 to 40 minutes.  Move to an upper rack and reduce the temperature to 325 degrees. Continue baking for an additional 30 to 40 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.
