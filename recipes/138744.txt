1 or 2 lbs Ground sirloin
2 Tomato puree 
1 Crushed Tomatoes
Fresh parsley
Fresh basil
Garlic 5-6 cloves minced
Onion - 1 large
Green Beans - 2 fresh bags organic 
Red peppers -1 large

Brown beef, onion and garlic and drain fat.

Add tomato purees, crushed tomatoes, parsley, and basil. LEt this all simmer for an hour.

What I like to do is cook vegetables partially before adding to stew. Do each vegetable seperately. When adding vegetables to stew, add a little of the water they're cooked in.  Blanch swisschard. 

Simmer until all vegetables are cooked. Depending upon how much vegetables you use will depend on how much puree and crushed tomatoes you will use, etc. Season as you like. Service with grated cheese.
