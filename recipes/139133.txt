Ingredients:
-Round polenta, about 1 tube
-Jar of tomato sauce in your favorite flavor
-Mozzarella cheese, either pre-shredded or whole
-Basil, to taste
-Olive Oil for pan
-1 white onion (optional)

Directions:
1. Cut the polenta into 1/2 inch thick slices. Throw out the ends if they are scraggly. Put a pan up to heat with olive oil, two turns of the pan.

2. When the pan is hot, put in your polenta slices. Be careful for the oil spitting! Wait until the edges look more grainy.

3. Flip over your polenta. Pour about half of your jar of sauce over the polenta, or enough to cover your polenta with a little extra sauce. Turn down your heat and let it simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.

4. If you are using onions, while your polenta is simmering, roughly dice a small white onion. It doesn't have to be perfect. Heat up another pan, put your onions in, and let them brown under low heat. You have to stir them up every so often, but they can mostly be left to their own devices. They know how to brown on their own.

5. About half-way through the cooking of the polenta, sprinkle cheese on top of the polenta. Be generous. If you are using fresh mozzarella, cut your sphere into small circles. Let them melt on top of the polenta for awhile. This may lengthen your cooking time.

6. When your cheese melts and your onions are brown, turn off the heat on both. Sprinkle basil on top to taste, and serve. Onions may be served on the side if you are eating with people who do not like onions, as is the case in my house.

7. Enjoy!
