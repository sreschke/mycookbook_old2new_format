Cut chicken thighs into 2-inch pieces.  Melt butter in heavy large Dutch oven, over medium heat.  Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper.  Add chicken to pot and saute until beginning to color, about 3 minutes.  Sprinkle with flour and 1 teaspoon thyme and stir one minute.  Add pearl onions, carrots, celery and broth, and bring liquids to simmer, scraping bottom of pot.

Combine baking mix, milk and 1/2 teaspoon thyme in small bowl.  Stir until soft dough forms.  Drop dough by heaping teaspoonfuls onto simmering stew.  Cover pot.  Reduce heat to medium-low; cook until dumplings are puffed and springy to touch, and chicken is cooked through, about 17 minutes.
