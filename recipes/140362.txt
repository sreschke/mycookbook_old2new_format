Cook note: I normally double this recipe and pour out into cookie sheet pan.

1 1/2 cup sugar
1/2 lb butter (no substitution)
1/4 tsp cream of tarter
6 plain Hershey candy bars
1/2 cup finely chopped nuts
9" x 9" cake pan - sprayed with non-stick spray

Cook sugar, butter and cream of tarter over medium-high heat until sugar is melted and starts turning brownish in color (about color of toffee in Heath Bars)....approximately 10 minutes.  Pour mixture into cake pan and smooth out evenly.  Immediate top with Hershey's candy bars, allowing a couple minutes for them to soften, then smoothing evenly over top of toffee.  Sprinkle with nuts.  Allow to cool and then break-up with ice pick or end of knife.  A real crowd pleasurer!
