Preparation

Preheat oven to 400ø.

Heat oil in a large heavy-bottom ovenproof skillet. Sprinkle tenderloin with salt and pepper, and cook on all sides 5 minutes or until well-browned.

Remove skillet from heat, and place tenderloin on a plate. Sprinkle tenderloin with garlic, rosemary, and 1 tablespoon thyme, pressing to adhere. Return tenderloin to skillet, and bake at 400ø for 20 minutes (to 145ø for medium rare) or to desired degree of doneness. Remove from skillet; let stand 10 minutes before slicing.

Add broth and wine to skillet, and place over medium-high heat; bring to a boil, and cook 7 minutes or until reduced to 1/2 cup. Reduce heat to low; whisk in butter one piece at a time. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon thyme. Serve with sliced tenderloin.
