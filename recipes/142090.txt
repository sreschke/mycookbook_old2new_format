Start your pasta water - always use your big pot and plenty of water.
Chop and prepare chilli and garlic, parsley etc.
Add pasta to salted *boiling* water - stirring occasionally.

Get a BIG frypan hot because at about the 3 minute mark, you need to add the Garlic.

Soften the garlic for 2 minutes
Add chilli,fennel seeds and capers. 
Stir fry for 1 minute, add anchovies and take off the heat. 
*Break the anchovies up WELL - use the wooden spoon etc... but break it up good. 
wait 2 minutes - stir Pasta etc. 

Turn the heat back onto your pan and when HOT - (just sizzling) add Marinara Mix and stir fry for 2-3 minutes.. coat the Seafood well with the pan juices and spices.
Add 1/2 wine.
Simmer.

*At about the 7 minute mark you should be able to remove the pasta from heat just before al 'dente -- (almost cooked) and Drain it. 

Then add the pasta to your pan with the seafood etc, toss and mix gently while adding remaining wine and fresh parsley - cover for a minute or two on Very LOW heat then SERVE....

Chilli garnish and a wedge of lemon - mayby a few more "optional" capers. 

And a crisp glass of semillon sav blanc, hopefully the rest of the botle that you used to cook the seafood. 

You can knock this up in 15-20 minutes and it will make you smile. Adjust the chilli to your liking. *You have to watch your timing and not overcook the pasta before adding it to the "pan"
