
Stir-Fried Chicken and Pineapple in Sweet and Sour Sauce

Fresh pineapple really makes a difference in this recipe. Half of one large pineapple will yield about 2 cups of chunks. But if the pineapple that is available isn't ripe, or you are in a rush, then look for already cut-up fresh pineapple in the produce section of your market. Turn to canned pineapple only as a last resort, and make sure that it is packed in juice, not syrup.

Serves 4 6 tablespoons red wine vinegar   
6 tablespoons orange juice   
6 tablespoons sugar   
3 tablespoons ketchup   
1 teaspoon cornstarch   
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts , trimmed  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil   
1 large red onion , halved and sliced 1/4 inch thick  
2 cups pineapple chunks (14 ounces)  
3 cloves garlic , minced  
1 tablespoon grated ginger   
2 scallions , sliced thin  


1. Whisk the vinegar, orange juice, sugar, ketchup, and cornstarch together.

2. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and, following the photos, slice it into 1/2-inch wide strips. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add the chicken and cook until no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.

3. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and heat over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook until just beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the pineapple and cook until heated through, about 1 minute.

4. Stir in the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Whisk the vinegar mixture to recombine, then add with the chicken to the skillet. Toss until all the ingredients are well coated with sauce. Sprinkle with the scallions before serving.
