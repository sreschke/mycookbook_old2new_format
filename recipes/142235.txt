Ingredients:

    * 1 tsp. minced fresh tarragon
    * 1 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. minced fresh chervil
    * 2 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. minced fresh chives
    * 1 1/8 tsp. kosher salt
    * 1/2 tsp. plus 1/8 tsp. freshly ground pepper
    * 12 eggs
    * 1/4 cup water
    * 4 tsp. unsalted butter
    * 8 oz. Brie cheese, cut into strips 1/4 inch thick

Directions:

In a small bowl, stir together the tarragon, chervil, chives, 1/8 tsp. of the salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper. Set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, water, the remaining 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper until frothy.

In a 9-inch nonstick omelette pan over medium-low heat, melt 1 tsp. of the butter, tilting the pan to evenly coat the bottom. Pour one-fourth of the egg mixture (about 3/4 cup) into the center of the pan and cook for 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, gently push the eggs from the edges of the pan toward the center to create large curds, then gently swirl the pan to evenly distribute the uncooked eggs. Cook for 1 minute more, swirling occasionally.

Sprinkle 1 Tbs. of the herb mixture over the omelette and cook until the eggs are just set, 2 to 3 minutes more. Lay one-fourth of the cheese on half of the omelette and fold the other side over the top. Gently slide the omelette onto a plate and keep warm in a 200Ã¸F oven. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to cook 3 more omelettes. Serve warm. Serves 4.
