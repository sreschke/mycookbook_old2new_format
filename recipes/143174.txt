
3/4 cup sugar
1 T cornstarch
3/4 cup water
juice of 1 orange (use the one that was zested the night before)

Blend the sugar and cornstarch in a large saucepan. Mix in the water. Place over medium high heat, stirring, until the mixture thickens and becomes clear (it will boil), about 5 minutes. Add the blueberries and salt and reduce the heat to low. Cook until the blueberries burst, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and lemon or lime juice to taste--tasting every teaspoon or so. Set aside and cover to keep warm until the casserole is done.
