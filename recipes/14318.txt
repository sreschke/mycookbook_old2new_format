Split raw shrimp from the back, leaving the tail on. Cut through back to make pocket for the stuffing.
Combine bread crumbs and ground seafood and stir in melted butter. Add seasonings and enough sherry to hold mixture together. Stuff each shrimp and place shrimp in shallow pan, back up, to prevent curling. Cook at 450 about 4 minutes or until shrimp turn white. Do not overcook. Serve in individual bowls with melted butter and lemon wedges.
