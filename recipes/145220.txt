2 cups mashed potatoes

1 cup all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons onion powder

Salt and pepper to taste

Vegetable oil

Combine potatoes, flour, onion powder, salt and pepper. Lightly flour a work surface and your hands. Form potato mixture into balls slightly larger than a golf ball and roll in flour. Flatten into a pancake and set aside on wax paper; repeat until all dough is used. Coat a griddle or skillet with cooking spray, pour in a thin layer of oil. Heat pan until a drop of water will dance on the surface. Carefully transfer pancakes to pan in batches and fry until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Watch carefully. Serve with sour cream, apple sauce or catsup, as a side for roast beef and gravy, chicken or pork.
