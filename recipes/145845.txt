Janet Murphy describes this recipe as ?Quick, easy and delicious.? It?s the Scottish version of chicken noodle soup, served to anyone who?s not feeling well or just needs to feel well cared for. If you have homemade chicken stock, substitute it for the water called for in the recipe and eliminate the bouillon cubes. For a richer soup, use heavy cream instead of milk.

6 leeks, roots and dark green leaves discarded

5 cups water, divided

1 teaspoon salt

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 chicken bouillon cubes

1/2 cup 2% milk

Salt and pepper

Carefully wash the light green leek stalks. Cut in half lengthwise and then across in 1/8-inch slices.

In a large saucepan, combine leeks, 3 cups water and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook 7 to 9 minutes or until leeks are tender. Raise heat and add butter, bouillon cubes and remaining 2 cups water. When bouillon cubes are dissolved, reduce heat, add milk and heat 1 minute more; taste for seasoning, then serve.
