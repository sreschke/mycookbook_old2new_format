Add the dried porcini to the boiling water and set aside. 

Heat the olive oil and add the leeks, shallots and garlic and cook until golden, about 3 minutes. Add all the fresh mushrooms, thinly sliced, and cook until the mushrooms soften and their liquid evaporates.

Once the soup is boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes. Add the cream and simmer for a further 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Add half the chopped parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper. 

To serve, ladle into individual bowls, sprinkle with extra parsley, some nutmeg and a small dollop of cream if desired.
