This makes enough for two very generous servings.  Buy 1 lb. crab.  Freeze 1/4 of it for crab salad sandwiches.

Paul suggested not sauteing the bread crumbs and using Asian jarred fried onions or garlic to make it easier than it already is.  Try that sometime.

1 portion nice fresh pasta (enough for two servings)
1 portion fresh bread crumbs (I used Panko)
5 cloves garlic, sliced
1 portion dried red pepper flakes
3/4 lb. crab meat
1 generous portion fresh mint leaves
1 portion ground black pepper
1-1/2 limes juiced
1 portion very good olive oil

Saute the sliced garlic in some olive oil on medium heat.  Try using small stainless skillet.  When just starting to brown, add bread crumbs and dried red pepper flakes.  Stir until everything is lightly brown.  Watch carefully, don't get too dark.
Add crab to skillet; stir, off the heat, just to warm the crab.

Boil pasta per directions.  Drain.  Add pasta to large serving bowl, add bread crumb & garlic mixture and a generous amount of mint leaves, and some black pepper.  Toss to combine.  Drizzle with lime juice and olive oil.  Toss again to blend.  Eat warm or cold.  It's nice both ways.
