First layer is a soften cream cheese. You can buy it in the container or take the brick of it and put milk in it with an electric mixer. Spread that on the bottom with a knife. Pour onto that a jar of salsa about 16-20 oz.(drain some of the liquid before you pour it onto the cream cheese). Layer that with a cup or two of shredded cheese of your choice. I like a Mexican Blend. Top with a 1/2 or full head of lettuce that you have shredded. Top with chopped cut up tomato. Open a huge bag of chips and go for it.
