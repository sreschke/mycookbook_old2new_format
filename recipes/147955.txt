This recipe uses a bread machine dough function to knead bread and make the first rise.  The pan should hold 2.5 lbs of dough.  You will also need two baguette baking pans (having lots of air holes on the curved surface).  

2 cups water
2 tsp salt
4 cups flour
4 tsp bread machine yeast

Place water, salt, flour and yeast in the bread machine pan in that order.  Start the kneeding process, usually a 45 minute program which includes time for raising the dough.  Add an additional 30 minutes of rising in the pan.

Remove from pan, allowing dough to fall out on a well floured (and clean) countertop.  Divide dough into 5 parts and shape each part into a ball,  sprinkling your hands, countertop and dough with flour as needed.  Cover dough with a clean towel and allow to rise an additional 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, generously flour the baguette pans.

Divide each dough ball in half, folding each part over itself twice and rolling into the shape of a baguette, producing 10 small baguettes.  Place each baguette on the baguette pan.  cover the breads and allow to rise an additional 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 480 F.  Place a hot pan of water on the bottom of the oven.  The water vapor is necessary to obtain the crust and color so unique to the French baguette.  When loaves have risen, use a razor blade or extremely sharp knife to slice the dough across the top diagonally in intervals four or five times.

Place the baguette pans in the oven and cook for 5 minutes on 480 and then reduce to 450 for an additional 25 minutes.  

The baguettes are done when well colored and sound hollow when tapped.  Allow to cool on a wire cooling rack before serving.
