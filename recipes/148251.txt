Broil peppers 4 in. from the heat until skins blister, about 5 minutes. With tongs, rotate peppers a quarter turn. Broil and rotate until all sides are blistered and blackened. Immediately place peppers in a large bowl; cover and let stand for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, cook the turkey, onion and garlic in oil until meat is no longer pink; drain. Add the tomatoes, corn, chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, salt, cumin, chili powder and pepper; heat through. Remove from the heat; stir in 2 tablespoons cilantro. Set aside.
Peel off and discard charred skins from poblanos. Cut a lengthwise slit down each pepper, leaving the stem intact; remove membranes and seeds. Fill each pepper with 1/2 cup turkey mixture.
Place peppers in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 375Ã¸ for 10-15 minutes or until cheese is melted. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro. Serve with sour cream. Yield: 4 servings.
