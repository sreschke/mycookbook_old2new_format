TIP: Adding 1/4 cup instant potato flakes makes this bread extra moist 
and fresh tasting. Use
it in white bread recipes too! 

3/4 cup warm water
2 1/2 teaspoons dry yeast
2 tablespoons softened butter
1/2 cup sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
1 1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
2 tablespoons milk powder
1/4 cup instant potato flakes
3 1/3 cups bread or all purpose flour
Milk for brushing
1 cup plumped raisins
1 tablespoon cinnamon
2 tablespoons sugar

Add dough ingredients to bread pan in order given. Press DOUGH 
Program. When dough is ready, roll out to a 12 by 10 inch rectangle. Brush
with milk, sprinkle on cinnamon, sugar, and raisins. Roll dough up into a log
and place in lightly greased 9 by 5 inch loaf pan. Let rise, lightly covered
in a large plastic bag, until dough puffs up over top of loaf pan (30-45
minutes). Bake 350 F, 35-45 minutes. 

* Notes: I just covered the dough with a cloth.  Didn't use a plastic 
bag.
