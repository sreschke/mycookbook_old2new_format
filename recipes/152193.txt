2 lbs hamburger meat
2 cans Cream of mushroom soup
1 can cheddar cheese soup
1 bag of tator tots
1 onion soup mix

Mix raw beef, 1 can mushroom soup and dry soup together.  Pat mixture into the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan.  Spread the second can of mushroom soup on top.  Spread cheese soup on top of mushroom soup.  Layer tater tots across to completely cover top. 

Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour to 90 minutes, or until meat is cooked and tater tots are beginning to crisp. 

My co-worker, Pam Fishburn, cooks her meat first and adds the other ingredients to it and then adds the tator tots on top.
