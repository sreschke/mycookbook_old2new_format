Flat Apple Pie
 
Makes 2 Pies
 

Freshly?picked Granny smith apples from Aisle 7 in our local A&P. 
&#9632;5 peeled and sliced Granny Smith apples
 &#9632;2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
 &#9632;Juice of « lemon
 &#9632;« cup granulated sugar
 &#9632;« cup firmly packed brown sugar
 &#9632;¬ teaspoon salt
 &#9632;1 recipe Perfect Pie Crust (below; makes 2 crusts)
 &#9632;4 tablespoons (« stick) butter
 
1. Preheat the oven to 375§F. In a large bowl, stir together the apples, flour, lemon juice, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and salt. Set aside.
 
2. Roll out two pie crusts into large circles. Place the circles on large baking sheets.
 
3. Place half the apple mixture on one crust and the other half on the other crust.
 
4. Fold over the edge of each crust so that it covers 2 to 3 inches of the apple mixture. No need to be artistic?the more rustic the better.
 
5. Dot the tops of the pies with chunks of butter.
 
6. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the filling is golden and bubbly. If the crust appears to brown too quickly, cover the edges with aluminum foil for the remaining baking time.
 
Note: If you have two ovens, it?s best to bake the pies separately. If not, just allow enough room between racks so the heat can circulate properly.
 
7. Allow to cool slightly, then slice into wedges with a pizza cutter. Eat ?em on the go!
 
Variation:
 
For extra sweetness, drizzle on jarred caramel topping after removing the pie from the oven.
 
Perfect Pie Crust
 
Makes two to three 9-inch pie crusts
 &#9632;3 cups all-purpose flour
 &#9632;1 teaspoon salt
 &#9632;1« cups vegetable shortening
 &#9632;1 egg
 &#9632;5 tablespoons cold water
 &#9632;1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
 
1. Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl.
 
2. Add in the shortening. Using a pastry cutter, gradually work the shortening into the flour until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles.  This step should take 3 or 4 minutes.
 
3. Lightly beat the egg with a fork, then add it to the mixture. Next, add in the cold water and vinegar. Stir the mixture together until it?s just combined, then remove half of the dough from the bowl.
 
4. Place in a large plastic bag (do not seal) and slightly flatten with a rolling pin. This makes it much easier to roll out the crust later. After flattening, seal the bag tightly. Repeat with the other half of the dough and place the plastic bags in the freezer until ready to use.
 
Note: Dividing the dough in half results in two pretty generous pie crusts. If you desire a thinner crust, you may divide the dough into three crusts.
 
5. When you?re ready to use a crust, remove one from the freezer and allow it to sit on the counter to thaw slightly, about 20 minutes. Remove from the bag and place on a lightly floured surface.
