You need a pretty big bowl to mix this in.  A clean dry dish pan will do the 
trick too.  Measure everything into the bowl one at a time.  The last step is 
dribbling in the oil.  Mix it all up with your hands or a fork.  This makes 
about 9 cups of mix.  Store it in a large coffee can, or a canister with a 
good lid.
