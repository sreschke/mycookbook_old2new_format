1 -15 oz can diced peaches, syrup drained and discarded

Preheat oven to 340.  Spray 9 x 13 inch casserole or oven to table dish with nonstick cooking spray.  Set aside.
Place the whole spaghetti squash onto a cookie sheet or directly on the grate of the oven. Bake for about 1 hour, until slightly darker in color and a little soft when you gently squeeze the sides.    Do not overcook.  Do not turn off oven.  Remove squash from oven and allow to cool until it is easy enough to handle.  Once the squash is cool, cut it in half lengthwise.  Scoop out and discard the seeds.  Use a fork to scrape the flesh into spaghetti-like strands and place them into a large mixing bowl.
Whisk eggs with sugar and add to the squash.  Pick out any loose seeds and discard.  Mix in the apple, peaches, and cinnamon.  Transfer to prepared baking dish.
In a medium pot, heat the margarine and brown sugar, stirring often.  When they are melted and smooth, remove from heat.  Add the cornflake crumbs and pecans.  Mix well.  Sprinkle over the squash.  With a sweeping motion, spray the top of the kugel lightly with nonstick cooking spray.  Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes, until the top is golden brown and the kugel does not jiggle when shaken.
