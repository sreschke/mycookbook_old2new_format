   2 1/4  cups          flour
     1/2  cup           cornstarch
   2 1/4  sticks        butter or margarine -- room temperature

Sift together flour and cornstarch onto sheet of waxed paper. Set aside. Beat butter and sugar in a med. bowl until blended. Stir in vanilla.
Gradually beat in flour mixture to make soft dough. Divide dough in half. Knead cocoa powder into 1/2 of dough in bowl. Flatten both doughs and wrap
separately in plastic wrap or waxed paper. Chill 1 hour or until easy to handle. Roll each batch of dough between 2 sheets of wax paper into 10" square. Push sides in to make absolutely even, using ruler or long-bladed knife. If dough becomes too soft or sticky, refrigerate on cookie sheet.
Remove top sheet of wax paper from nonchocolate dough; Brush top with egg white. Remove paper from top of chocolate dough; invert onto nonchocolate
dough, matching sides up exactly. Peel off remaining sheet of wax paper. Cut into 4 equal strips, each 10x2 1/3". Brush lightly with egg white. Stack dough strips neatly to make 8 alternateing layers. Wrap stack in plastic wrap. Chill several hours or overnight. Dough can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.
Oven to 375 degrees. Cut dough crosswise into slices slightly less than 1/4" thick. Place slices on cookie sheets, 1" apart Bake 10 min. Transfer cookies to wire rack to cool completely. Store
cookies in tightly covered containers in cool, dry place.
