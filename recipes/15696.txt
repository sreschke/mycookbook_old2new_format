Causa de Camarones (Shrimp Causa)

1 kilo cooked shrimp
1 medium onion, chopped fine
250 grams yellow pepper, chopped fine (this sounds like a lot to me; just use enough to get the taste you like. I can't advise on the kind of pepper, but I think it's supposed to be at least a little bit "hot")
juice of 5 lemons
3 pinches black or white pepper (white preferred)
dash cayenne (optional)
3 kilos potatoes (a kind good for mashing)
cooking oil
mayonnaise
4 tomatoes
3 ribs celery
1 jigger vinegar 
2 hard-cooked eggs
salt to taste

Mix the onion, lemon juice, salt, black or white pepper, chopped pepper and cayenne in a bowl and set aside.
Cook the potatoes and mash, adding enough oil little by little to make a soft "dough". Work in the onion mixture. (You may not want to add all the lemon juice at once; add to taste).
Spread about a third of the potato mixture in a square or rectangular dish or baking pan. Add a layer of shrimp reserving some for garnish, then a layer of mayonnaise. Add another layer of potato mixture, then a layer of sliced tomatoes and chopped celery. Cover with the rest of the potato mixture. Garnish with shrimp, slices or wedges of hard-cooked egg, and mayonnaise. Serves 8.


Causa with Tuna

Prepare potato mixture as above, but add only the lemon juice to the potatoes; reserve the marinated onions and peppers. Spread half the mixture in a dish or pan. Substitute a can of flaked tuna for the shrimp. Mix the tuna with the onions and peppers. Spread on top of the potato mixture. Spread the rest of the potato mixture on top. Garnish with egg, pieces of pepper, parsley, olives, mayonnaise, or anything else you like.

Causa #2

Make the potato mixture as described above, using mashed potatoes, lemon juice and cayenne to taste. Form into balls about the size of golf balls. Garnish with a parsley leaf and a small piece of red pepper. Serve as hors d'oeuvre.
