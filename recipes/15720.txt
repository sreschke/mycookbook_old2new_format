  Preheat oven to 200 degrees F.  Spray an 8-inch square baking dish with vegetable cooking spray.
  In a small bowl, combine flour and baking powder.  Mix well.  In a medium bowl, combine egg whites, milk, mustard, and honey.  Mix well.  Stir flour mixture into milk mixture until just combined.  Stir in corn, ham, and green onion.
  In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat, tilting pan to coat bottom.  Pour batter into skillet making 3 1/2 inch rounds.
  Cook corn cakes until tops are bubbly, about 1 min.  Reduce heat to low; using a flat spatula, turn cakes and cook until golden brown, about 2-3 min.  Place cakes in prepared dish; cover with foil and place in a warm oven while cooking remaining corn cakes.
  Place corn cakes on serving plates.  Serve immediately with salad dressing.
