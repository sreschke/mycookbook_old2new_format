2 10 oz packages of baby spinach, washed
3-4 Tbs salted butter
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
3-4 Tbs all purpose flour
2 cups milk
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese (optional)
1/2 tsp white pepper (or nutmeg if you prefer -- it really brings out the flavor of spinach)
salt to taste

And here's what you do:

Cook the spinach in a pot of boiling water for just one minute, add to a cold water bath to stop the cooking, and then squeeze out the excess water from the leaves. Chop the spinach (or throw in a food processor) and set aside.

Now's the important part -- making the sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the garlic and onion, and cook until just soft. Add in the flour, stirring it together to form a paste. Slowly whisk in the milk and cook until slightly thickened. Enjoy this sight, it's the transformation of raw ingredients into the most wonderful sauce in the world. Stir in the parmesan, add in the spinach, white pepper and salt.

Serve right away -- preferably with an awesome piece of steak.
