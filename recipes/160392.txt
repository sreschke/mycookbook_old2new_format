2 pieces of chicken thighs per person, This is enough to cook 8 thighs
1 can of vegetable soup
1 can of tomatoe soup
Olive Oil
6 fresh basil leaves
2 tbls of dried oregano
1 lrg onion chopped
4 cloves of garlic, chopped
1 gt of homemade chicken stock
Water
Salt and pepper to taste
Italian Sausage Seasoning
1 can of diced tomatoes. I get the kind with basil and oregano in it. 

In a large heavy pot heat enough olive oil to cover the bottom. Season the chicken thighs with Italian Sausage seasoning and in small batches cook in the olive oil until browned. Remove as they are done and set aside on a platter. When all of the chicken thighs are browned remove pan from heat. Dump out 2/3 of the oil and fat that has accumulated. Scrape out the chicken skin etc that has stuck to the bottom. Cool on paper towels and snack on while cooking. 
Heat up the remaining oil in the pot and add the chopped onions and garlic. Saute for 10 min or so. Add all of the chicken back in. They will be stacked on top of each other. This is OK. Then add in all of the other ingrediants and a little more Italian Sausage seasoning and stir to mix. Add water as necessary so that all of the chicken is covered with the liquid. 
Cook over low heat for an hour or until the meat is falling off of the bone. 
Serve over Polenta
