1 lb spaghetti
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
3 large cloves garlic, very finely chopped
6-7 ounces pancetta, cubed very small
4 eggs
1 cup regular milk
1/2 cup heaping pecorino romano
Salt
Freshly ground pepper

1. Start boiling water to cook spaghetti. Timing is important because you want the pasta to be hot  to cook the eggs.

2. Heat up olive oil in small frying pan over med heat. Add the garlic & pancetta. Fry until the pancetta is golden and beautifully crisp. When it's done, take off heat and set aside.

3. Separate the eggs. Put each yolk in a seperate little cup and set aside until ready to serve. The whites go into a bowl; add the milk, pecorino, lots of freshly ground pepper and whisk to combine. Keep whisking while spaghetti cooks. 

4. When pasta is ready, turn off heat and drain it well and put back into pot. Work very quickly -- throw the pancetta w/it's oil in pot, put milk mixture in and stir well until everything is coated and thickens. The egg whites will cook from the heat.

5. Divide the pasta among serving bowls. On top of each, please an egg yolk and serve immediately!
