4 apples (like Fugi, Jonagold, Honeycrist)
1/4 cup brown sugar (I used Muscovado)
1/4 cup oatmeal
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 pinch cloves (Grind about 4 cloves)
1 tablespoon butter, plus more for syrup
1 cup HOT water

Optional extras: Black walnuts, orange peel, candied ginger, grated ginger, raisons, cream cheese, Nutella, peanut butter.

To serve:  Ice cream, creme fraiche, sour cream, or whipped cream.

Preheat oven to 375 with rack in lower middle position.

Use a corer to core a little from bottom of apples.  Then core out most of the top.  DO NOT GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH.  Cut the top core about 1" wide.  

Mix brown sugar, oatmeal, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a small bowl.  Divide this mixture between the 4 apples, packing the wells firmly.

Arrange the apples in a baking dish.  (Use my square metal pan.)  Pour water around the apples.  Top loosely with a piece of foil.  Bake 20 minutes.  Remove foil, and continue baking another 20 or 30 minutes.  (Last time I went the full 30, and a couple of the apples split open, so perhaps don't bake quite that long.)  Test apples for by sliding a small knife into one of the apples.  If there is no resistance, apples are done.

Cool slightly, them remove apples to a holding dish.  Pour water mixture into small saucepan; add another dollop of butter, and boil until reduced, thick, and syrupy.  I have tried also adding a splash of apple brandy.  Perhaps let the alcohol cook off a little next time.

Leftovers will keep up to 1 week and can be microwaved, or eaten cold.  Serve with your choice of embellishment mentioned above.
