First make the ganache:
1 C whipping cream 
8 oz chocolate chips 
Microwave 1 min. Stir carefully until smooth. Place in the fridge for about 2 hours- until firm- or place in freezer for about 30-45 min. DO NOT FREEZE!

Make favorite chocolate chip cookie dough. 

Once ganache is firm, assemble cakes:
Scoop about a little less than 1/4 C of dough. 
Make a ball and flatten to a disc. 
Scoop a tablespoon of ganache- roll into a ball. Place on cookie dough disc. 
Bring sides of dough up around ganache and roll into a ball - make sure all of the ganache is enveloped in cookie dough. 
Place in a well greased ramekin.
Bake at 350 for 12-15 min. Top of dough should be lightly browned- like a chocolate chip cookie.
