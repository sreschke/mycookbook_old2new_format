Ingredients

1 (2-pound) beef tenderloin, trimmed and tied
2 quarts beef stock
2 cups ruby port
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper
1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves

Directions

Place the beef and broth in a 6-quart Dutch oven, making sure the beef is totally covered by the stock, and cover with foil, leaving a small opening for steam to escape. Poke a small hole in the foil and insert an instant-read thermometer into the meat. Cook over low heat until the beef reaches 125 degrees F, 55 to 60 minutes. Transfer the beef to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes.

In a medium saucepan, bring the port to a boil and then reduce until about 1/3 cup. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter. Season with salt and pepper.

To serve, slice the beef, top with sauce and garnish with parsley.
