First time, 1 cup water not enough.  It almost completely evaporated.  2nd. time, 1-1/2 cups too much.  What to do??

1/8 cup salt
1/4 cup honey
6 dried bay leaves
juice of 1 lemon
1 tablespoon peppercorns
1 turkey thigh (1-1/2 lb)
1 medium onion, sliced into half moons
1 large potato, cut into chunks
1-1/2 cups chicken stock (original recipe called for only 1 cup, but it almost completely evaporated.)
Olive oil
sprinkle of sage & thyme

Use recipe for brining in Culinary Intelligence cookbook page 223.  Half a recipe of brining ingredients enough to completely submerge 1 thigh (1-1/2 lb.).  

After brining, dry thigh with paper towels.  Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400.

Smear a small amount of olive oil on bottom of large Pyrex baking dish (If I'm not including the vegetables, use my large Le Creuset square red casserole).  Put thigh into dish skin side down.  Roast 30 minutes.  Turn thigh over, add water to dish, distribute potatoes and onions around thigh.  Pour a little olive oil over thigh.  Sprinkle sage & thyme over.  Bake for 15 minutes.  Stir or turn potatoes and onions.  Bake another 15 minutes.  A 2 lb. thigh takes an extra 10 minutes.  For 1 lb. thigh lower the temperature to 375 for the last 30 min.  Remove from oven and cover with foil for 20 minutes before serving.
