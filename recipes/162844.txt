1 roll of hot or spicy sausage
2 cups of flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 Tablespoons Sugar
2 Tablespoons Cornmeal
1/2 Cup Shortening (not vegetable oil)
3/4 Cup plus 1 Tablespoon of sweet milk

Blend shortening with dry ingredients
Add milk and mix well
Turn onto floured surface. (I take a piece of wax paper and use that to knead the dough. Then you can just throw way - easy clean up plus you can use it to wrap it up for freezing. 
Knead the dough 1 minute
Roll about 1/4 inch
Spread each half with 1/2 pound of sausage which has been softened to room temperature. 
Roll as for a jelly roll
Freeze for about 30 to 45 minutes. Just long enough to get to cutting/slicing consistency 
Slice 1/4 inch thick
Bake in 400 degree oven for 15-20 minutes
Makes about 50 pinwheels.
