2 lbs Italian sausage 
5 carrots (one for mirepoix) cut on bias
4 cloves of garlic ( one for mirepoix)
1 to 2 onions ( one for mirepoix)

2 cups shell pasta
2 cups kale or spinach (spinach last minute) 
Salt and pepper garlic powder other seasoning of your choice i use cayenne.
Corn ( optional) i sauted it first.
I do a mirepoix first: Saute Celery carrot and onion garlic last minute, in butter or oil salt and pepper.
Cook sausage in skillet when done pour all of it including drippings in the crock pot.
Add all ingredients in crock pot except pasta and kale/spinach, kale works better i think. 
Cook for few hours to have it come together well on medium or high. 
Put pasta in last hour or half hour ( keep and eye on it and lower heat as u dont want it to get to soft) 
Put kale/spinach last.
Parmesan cheese may be used on top.
