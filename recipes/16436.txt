Ingredients

4 Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts
Oil free Italian salad dressing for marinade (just enough to cover chicken.)
4 large pieces of aluminum foil.
Veggies listed below are examples for 4 servings.
You may use any vegetable you like.
	4 Cups of Carrots, sliced
	4 Cups of Potatoes cubed.
	4 Cups of Celery, sliced
                1 Medium or Large White Onion, sliced,                 divided 4 ways
You may also wish to use any color of bell pepper, also squash, zucchini, tomatoes, and so on.

Directions:
Marinate the chicken breasts in the Italian salad dressing for 30 minutes to 2 hours.
While chicken marinates, cut and slice vegetables.
After marinating, place chicken in the center, (on the shiny side), of a large piece of foil. Pile all your vegetables on top of the chicken. This is fun for the kids. Let them build their own packet. Fold the foil packet to form a tent over the chicken and vegetables and seal tight. Place on grill for about 30 minutes or until chicken is done or place on a baking sheet and cook in a 400% oven for about 40 minutes. Open packets carefully avoiding very hot steam. All you need to complete this dinner is a green salad and bread.
