Makes 4 servings

3/4 cup cornmeal
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 cup milk
6 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 fresh jalapeno chili, stemmed, seeded, and chopped
1 1/2 cups (6 oz.) shredded jack cheese
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
salt and pepper
8 fresh poblano chilies (2 lbs. total; also called pasillas)
3/4 cup chopped onion
1 can (4 oz.) chopped green chilies
1/2 cup half-and-half (light cream)

1. In a 2-3 quart pan over medium-high heat, stir cornmeal, 1 1/2 cups water, milk, 3 tablespoons butter, 1/2 cup corn, red bell pepper, and jalapeno until mixture bubbles and cornmeal no longer fells gritty about 5 minutes.
2. Stir 3/4 cup cheese and cilantro into cornmeal mixture. Let stand until just cool to touch.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
3. About 1/2 inch below stems, cut tops crosswise off poblanos; save tops. With a fork, scrape out and discard seeds and pith. Holding a chili upright, spoon in cornmeal mixture, pushing gently with spoon and shaking gently to fill chili to rim. Replace poblano tops and secure with toothpicks.
4. Lay poblanos on their sides in a shallow 10-15 inch casserole. Cover tightly with foil and bake in a 375 degree oven until chilies are tender when pierced, 40-45 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, in a 1-2 quart pan over medium heat, frequently stir onion in remaining butter until limp, 8 to 10 minutes.
6. Remove toothpicks from poblanos and spoon sauce over chiles. Add salt and pepper to taste.
