Preheat oven to moderate.  Brush a shallow 20x30cm tin with melted butter or oil and then line the base with baking paper, extending over 2 of the sides.
Combine dates, water and sugar in a small pan.  Cook for 15 mins. stirring occasionally, until the liquid has been absorbed.  Leave to cool.  Beat the butter and brown sugar in a small mixing bowl, using electric beaters, until light and creamy.  Transfer to a large mixing bowl.  Stir in the sifted flour and bicarb with rolled oats.  Mix well.
Place half the mixture in the prepared tin.  Press evenly onto the base and spread with date filling.  Using a fork, spread the remainder of the filling, pressing down lightly.  Bake for 35-40 mins, or until cooked and golden brown.  Cool in the tin on a wire rack.  Sprinkle with caster sugar and cut into squares or fingers while still warm.
Makes about 20 slices.
