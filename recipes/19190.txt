 14 1/2 oz Beef broth
     12 oz Dark beer

  Instead of cabbage, try mustard greens or collard greens with your corned
  beef for an interesting change of pace.
  
  Preheat oven to 325 F.  Rinse corned beef under cold water to remove
  spices; pat dry.  In a 6 qt dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add
  corned beef, fat side down, and cook, turning once, until browned on both
  sides, 5-7 minutes.  Remove to a cutting board and carve corned beef into
  1/2 inch slices.
  
  In same pot, cook onions over medium heat, stirring occasionally til
  golden, 3-5 minutes.  Add broth, beer, garlic and pepper. Layer corned beef
  slices and potato slices in onion/broth mixture.
  
  Cover and bake 2 1/2 hours.  Add greens to pot.  Cover and bake 15 minutes
  longer.
