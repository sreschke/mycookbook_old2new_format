Preheat oven to 400F degrees. From Part 1: Melt the margarine in a large saucepan. Cook the onion and garlic in it until tender and remove from heat. Add the cashews and bread to the onion & garlic, then add the vegetable stock, nutmeg, lemon juice, and salt & pepper. Put half of this mixture into a non-stick or greased loaf pan. Set aside unused portion of mixture.

Mix together all ingredients from Part 2 list. Put this "stuffing" on top of the mixture in the loaf pan and add the rest of the Part 1 mixture on top of the "stuffing" so that there are three layers in the pan. Place loaf pan on baking sheet and bake at 400F degrees for 30 minutes; Top should be browned. Allow to cool slightly before serving. This recipe makes 4-6 servings and will take about an hour to prepare. The loaf refrigerates well and can be frozen for a few months and microwaved back to life.
