From MMMMiami--Tempting Tropical Tastes for Home Cooks Everywhere by Carole Kotkin and Kathy Martin

My friend Sis Kelm, who lives part of the year at The Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo, is a wonderful Southern cook.  She makes the best iced tea. Here
is her recipe.

9 tea bags
1-1/2 quarts boiling water
10 sprigs fresh spearmint
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup lemon juice

Place tea bags in a large bowl.  Pour boiling water over bags and let steep for 5 minutes. Discard bags. Add remaining ingredients.  Stir well.  Cool
and remove mint leaves.  Pour into a pitcher and refrigerate.
