Take 2 lbs fresh broccoli, wash, and cut in bite-size pieces, use the small stalks, too. Add 1/2 cup chopped red onion, 1/2 cup sunflower seeds, and 1/2 pound fried, drained and crumbled bacon. The dressing is as follows: 2 cups mayo, (I used Miracle Whip), 1/4 cup sugar, 2 T. red wine vinegar. Mix well and pour over broccoli mixture when ready to serve. Enjoy!
