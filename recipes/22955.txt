6T margarine
2 T flour
3/4 cup milk
3 or 4 cooked deboned chicken pieces
frozen peas
frozen carrots
1 can of chicken broth
cooked elbow macaroni

(this recipe is in my head so pardon if it's not fancy). Melt the margarine
over the stove and add the flour so it makes a paste.  Add your milk and
chicken broth till it's sorta thick.  Add peas and carrots - cook for a little
while then and your chicken.  Next add your macaroni and stick it in the oven
for about 30 min on 350 so the peas and carrots can cook a little.  I usually
add bread crumbs to the top.  That's it.
