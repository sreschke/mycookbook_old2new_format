4 whole chicken breasts, skinned, split, boned, and fat trimmed
Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1/2 cup fruity white wine, or water
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
3/4 cup fruity olive oil
4 sprigs fresh tarragon, or 1 teaspoon dried tarragon leaves,crumbled
Zest of 1 small lemon, removed with a vegetable peeler
4 tablespoons raisins, plumped in hot water for 15 minutes and drained
Arugula leaves for garnish

Slightly flatten the chicken breasts with the palm of your hand. Place in a lightly oiled, shallow roasting pan.  Lightly salt and pepper.  Add the wine or water to the pan.  Cover with lightly oiled
parchment paper or wax paper cut to just fit the pan.  Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F oven for about 10 minutes or until cooked through.  Let the chicken cool in the pan. Whisk together the vinegar and olive oil in a bowl.  Add the tarragon, lemon zest, and raisins.  Arrange the chicken breasts in 1 layer in a shallow dish just large enough to hold them.  Pour the dressing over the chicken.  Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator
at least 12 hours, turning the chicken occasionally.  Before serving, return to room temperature.  Place the arugula leaves on individual
plates or on a platter and arrange the chicken on the leaves.  [I put the leaves on a platter.  I sliced the chicken into strips and put the strips of chicken on top of the leaves.]  Garnish with the raisins and lemon zest, and drizzle a little of the marinade over the chicken. Serves 4 to 6.
