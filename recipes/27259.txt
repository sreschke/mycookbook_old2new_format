2 c. cooked brown rice	
1 apple, chopped
1/2 c. soy milk	
1 tsp. Cinnamon
2 tsp. Honey	
2 Tbs. Raisins
Directions:
Mix all ingredients together in a medium bowl. Jam could be used in place of honey, and any fruit you like. I also added 1/4 cup crushed pineapple with some of it's natural juice. I microwaved it for approx. 30 seconds, just to take the chill off.
