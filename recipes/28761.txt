1 lb. spiral macaroni, cooked & drained (I used the multi-colored)
3 medium tomatoes, diced
1 lb. cheddar cheese, cubed
1-2 bunches green onions, sliced
3 oz. pepperoni slices (I cut them in half for better distribution)

Dressing:
3/4 c. veg oil (I use canola)
2/3 c. grated parmesan cheese
1/2 c. red wine vinegar
2 tsp. dried oregano
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp. salt

Combine salad ingredients.  In separate bowl, combine dressing ingredients; mix well.  Toss salad with dressing; cover, chill several hours or over night.  Just before serving, top with croutons.  [16 servings]
(I think sliced black olives would be great in this, too, and plan to add them next time.)
