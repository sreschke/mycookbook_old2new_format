Sit at dining table.

Place drained corn husks onto a plate.  place a bolw of masa near you.  Place a fingerbowl of warm water within easy reach. Place a large dinner plate directly in front of you. Place a bowl of the meat mixture near you.  You are ready to start spreading the tamales.  In my family this is where everyone gets into the act.

Take a large corn husk with little or no rips or tears, and spread the masa evenly from the middle of the husk toward the large end of the husk.  If the husk is large enough add a spoonfull of the meat mixture and roll like a burrito.  flip the skinny half with no masa or filling up over the seam and place in the the steamer.  Place a many tamales in the steamer as can fit with out stuffing it.  Cook for 60 min.  Let cool for 10 min after removal from the steamer so they firm up.  enjoy.
