2 Cups diced, unpealed red apples ( about 4 to 5 medium apples)
1 (20 oz.) can crushed pineapple
2 Cups miniature marshmallows
1/2 Cup sugar
1 Tblsp. flour
1 egg beaten
2 Tblsp. apple cider vinegar (or white vinegar)
1 8 oz. Cool Whip

Drain pineapple and reserve juice. Mix pineapple and marshmallows. Refrigerate overnight.
Combine reserved pineapple juice, flour, sugar, vinegar, and egg. Cook over medium heat until thick like pudding. Refrigerate overnight. Next day: Blend thickened juice and Cool Whip. Add peanuts and diced apples, then add pineapple-marshmallow mixture and mix well. Refrigerate several hours to blend flavors. 
Note: Do not cut apples until ready to add to dressing, as they will start to  turn brown once they are cut.
