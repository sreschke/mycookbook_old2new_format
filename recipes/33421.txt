Its called "fettunta" in Tuscany and "bruschetta" in Umbria, but both names mean a thick slice of country bread toasted over a wood fire, in the oven
or on the grill,  and anointed with extra virgin olive oil. Fettunta is eaten as a snack or appetizer.

18 pieces crusty Italian bread, 3 x 2 ", 1" thick (may be purchased at artisan bakeries)
2 cloves garlic, peeled and cut in half
18 fresh basil leaves
Â« cup extra virgin olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 large ripe but not overripe tomatoes (about 1 pound total weight)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees, or heat grill.  Place the pieces of bread on the shiny side of a piece of aluminum foil or directly on the grill, and
toast them for 10 minutes on each side, or until nicely browned.  Then rub both sides of each slice with the cut garlic.  Arrange the basil leaves on
a large platter; then put the pieces of bread over them.  Warm the oil in a small saucepan over very low heat for 5 minutes. Do not allow it to boil. 
Immediately pour the warm oil over the bread.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.  Cut the tomatoes horizontally into 1-inch thick slices;
then cut each in half.  Place 1 half-slice of tomato on top of each slice of bread and serve immediately.  Serves 6.
