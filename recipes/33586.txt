Oven to 350*.  Stir 1/2 cup flour, salt and pepper together in a flat dish.  Lightly coat fillets, shaking off any excess.
In a large non-reactive skillet, heat 1/4 cup oil over medium-high heat, almost to smoking point.  Quickly brown both sides of fillets, about 1 minute per side.  Do in two batches if necessary so that pan remains very hot.  In a non-reactive baking pan large enough to hold fillets in a single layer, pour 1/4 cup white wine and juice from one lemon.  Place fillets in pan and bake in center of oven 8 to 10 minutes or until just cooked through.
     Meanwhile, wipe out pan you cooked fish in with paper towels and heat remaining 2 tbsps of oil over medium heat.  Add garlic and saute 2 minutes, or just until beginning to take on color.  Add roasted peppers, artichoke hearts, capers and mushrooms if using, and remaining 1/4 cup white wine.  Cook until wine is reduced to just a shimmer in the pan.  Stir in butter and remaining 2 tbsps. flour.  Cook about 2 minutes.  Then stir in chicken broth, juice from remaining lemon, basil and romano cheese.  Cook, stirring gently, until slightly thickened.
     To serve, divide pasta among 4 plates.  Place a fillet on top of each and divide sauce over the tops.
