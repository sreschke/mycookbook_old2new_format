Baker Boulanger
About 2 1/2 dozen biscuits 

5 cups all purpose flour
8 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
3 tablespoons sugar
1/4 cup cold, unsalted butter
1/2 cup cold, shortening
5 teaspoons dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water
1 3/4 - 2 cups warm buttermilk
melted butter (optional)

In a large bowl, stir flour, baking powder, salt, soda and sugar. Cut
shortening into dry ingredients until crumbly and well distributed. 

In a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and stir briefly.
Allow to dissolve and swell. Add yeast and warm buttermilk to dry
ingredients and toss with a fork to blend and moisten, creating a soft
dough. 

Cover bowl and refrigerate (at least overnight - can be kept in the fridge
for a couple of weeks). 

When you want fresh biscuits, remove a portion of dough. Preheat oven to
400 F. On a lightly floured board, roll dough out to a thickness of one inch
or so. Cut into rounds, wedges or squares with a knife or biscuit cutter.
Brush generously with melted butter. 

Place on baking sheet and brush, if desired with melted butter (or sprinkle
lightly with a touch of flour). Bake until lightly browned on top, about 12-15
minutes.
