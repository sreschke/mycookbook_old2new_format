Divide each portion of dough in half. Roll 1 part white dough into a 10x8-inch rectangle between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Set aside. Repeat with 1 part pink dough. Remove top sheet of plastic wrap from both the pink and the white dough. Place pink dough over white dough; remove plastic wrap from pink dough. Trim edges, if desired.
