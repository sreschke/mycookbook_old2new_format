FIRST STEP;  MAKE TOMATO SAUCE
Chop large onion, garlic and parsley fine and fry slightly in the hot oil.  Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaves, salt, pepper, water and stir until well mixed.  Then add the ground beef, breaking it in litle pieces with a fork.  Cover sauce, cook over a low heat for 45 minutes.  Stir occasionally.

STEP TWO;  CHEESE SAUCE
Chop small onion fine and cook in the melted butter or margarine a minute or two.  Mix in the flour smoothly.  Add grated Parmesan cheese and a dash of salt.  Gradually stir in milk and continue cooking over low heat, stirring constantly, until sauce is thick as heavy crea.  Beat egg yolks slightly, mix in a little hot cheese mixture slowly (to prevent sauce from Curdling).  Then mix all the cheese mixture and yolks together and cook over low heat for 10 minutes longer.  Remove from heat.

STEP THREE, ASSEMBLE
Start your oven at 325 degrees (slow) and grease a large baking dish.  Now put a layer of noodles on the bottom of baking dish.  Add enough tomato sauce to cover and add part of the cheese sauce.  Continue layers until the two sauces are used up.  Top with mozzerella cheese if desired.
