This recipe is for people who like their fudge to have some texture, rather than being creamy smooth, but it still melts in your mouth. To make peanut butter fudge, reduce butter to 1/4 cup, eliminate cocoa, and stir in 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter after cooking. 

1/2 c butter 
2-1/4 c sugar 
6 tbsp cocoa 
1 tbsp light corn syrup 
1 small can (10 tbsp) evaporated milk 

Line bottom and sides of an 8" square baking dish with foil. Mix all ingredients in a large saucepan. Cook and stir to soft-ball stage (236 degrees). Remove from heat. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until fudge begins to thicken and lose its gloss. Pour into pan; score cutting lines with a serrated knife.
