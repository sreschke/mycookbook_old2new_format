2 heads garlic
8 1/2 t olive oil
4 large Idaho baking potatoes
coarse salt and ground pepper
1 bunch fresh thyme

Heat oven to 300 degrees. Wrap garlic in foil and roast until golden and soft, about 1 hour. Let stand until cool enough to handle. Slice off tip of each head to expose cloves. Press out garlic. Discard skin and transfer garlic to small bowl. Add 4 1/2 t olive oil, salt and pepper. Make a paste using the back of a spoon. 

Raise oven temperature to 475 degrees. Slice each potato crosswise into 1"-thick pieces. Spread paste on each slice and reassemble potato, pressing to potato sticks together. Set potato on a piece of foil; drizzle with 1 t olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Wrap tightly in foil; repeat with the other potatoes. 

Bake potatoes in a roasting pan or on a baking sheet until they are soft and have a caramelized roasted garlic crust on the bottom, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Serve crust side up on a bed of fresh thyme.
