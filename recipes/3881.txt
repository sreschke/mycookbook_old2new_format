Use to season poultry, pork or fish.  Is especially nice as a "rub" on salmon fillets.

To use on salmon fillets:  Rinse fillets and pat dry.  Place seasoning in lower section of Cajun Batter Pan.  Shake vigorously and flip pan over to season other side.  Shake off excess seasoning and place fillets in plastic bag.  Let sit in fridge for several hours.

When ready to cook fillets: first rub them down with olive oil and brown sugar.  Grill for 3.5 to 4 minutes on counter grill...or 4-5 minutes each side on gas grill until bronzed!
