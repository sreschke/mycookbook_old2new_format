Sourdough Bread Ingredients: 
        2 1/4 tsp. Active Dry Yeast
        1/2 cup Warm Water (110-F Degrees)
        1 1/2 cups Sourdough Starter Batter
        1 Tbs. Granulated  Sugar
        1 tsp. Salt
        1 1/2 tsp. Baking Soda
        5 to 6 cups All-purpose Flour

To prepare your sourdough starter, dissolve yeast in the warm water in a
medium bowl.
Stir in the flour and lukewarm water, add sugar and salt. Beat until smooth
with an
electric mixer. Let stand 3 to 5 days uncovered at room temperature,
making sure to 
stir 2 or 3 times a day. Cover at night to prevent drying. 

To prepare your sourdough bread, soften active dry yeast in a large mixing
bowl with 
1/2 cup warm water. Blend in sourdough starter batter with 1 tablespoon
sugar and 
1 teaspoon salt. Add 3 1/2 cups flour and beat with an electric mixer to
combine,
beating at least 3 to 4 minutes to blend thoroughly. Cover and let rise
until doubled.

Mix baking soda with remaining flour and add to dough. Add enough flour to
make the
dough stiff. Turn out onto a floured board and knead 8 to 10 minutes.
Shape into one
large or 2 medium loaves and place on lightly greased baking sheet. With a
sharp knife, 
slice diagonal cuts across top of dough. Let rise again until doubled. 

Bake in a pre-heated oven at 400-F degrees. Medium loaves require about
35 to 40
minutes to bake; a large loaf takes about 40 to 45 minutes.

Kitchen Staff Tips: If you like the idea of keeping your sourdough
bread-making efforts
alive, you may elect to keep your sourdough starter batter going,
indefinitely. To do so, 
add 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup flour, and 1 teaspoon sugar to your starter and
let stand for 
2 days. Cover the sourdough starter batter and refrigerate until used
again. If starter 
is not used within a couple of days, just add a teaspoon of granulated sugar
every 10 
days to keep it alive.
