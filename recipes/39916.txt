 Popeye's? Fried Chicken

3 cups Self-rising flour 
1 cup Cornstarch 
3 tablespoons Seasoned salt 
2 tablespoons Paprika 
1 teaspoon Baking soda 
1 package Italian Salad Dressing Mix, dry 
1 1/2 ounces Pk Onion Soup Mix 
1/2 ounce Pk spaghetti sauce mix 
3 tablespoons Sugar 
3 cups Corn flakes, crush slightly 
2 Eggs, well beaten 
1/4 cup Cold water 
4 pounds Chicken, cut up 
Combine first 9 ingredients in large bowl. Put the cornflakes into another bowl. Put eggs and water in a 3rd bowl. Put enough corn oil into a heavy roomy skillet to fill it 1" deep. Get it HOT! Grease a 9x12x2 baking pan. Set it aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Dip chicken pieces 1 piece at a time as follows:
1-Into dry coating mix.
2-Into egg and water mix.
3-Into corn flakes.
4-Briskly but briefly back into dry mix.
5-Drop into hot oil, skin-side-down and brown 3 to 4 minutes on medium high. Turn and brown other side of each piece. Don't crowd pieces during frying. Place in prepared pan in single layer, skin-side-up. Seal in foil, on 3 sides only, leaving 1 side loose for steam to escape. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes removing foil then to test tenderness of chicken.
Allow to bake uncovered 5 minutes longer to crisp the coating. Serves 4. Leftovers refrigerate well up to 4 days. Do not freeze these leftovers. Leftover coating mix (1st 9 ingredients) can be stored at room temp in covered container up to 2 months.
