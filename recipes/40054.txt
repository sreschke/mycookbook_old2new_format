       4 cups water 
       6 cups chicken stock 
       2 potatoes, peeled & sliced 
       2 carrots, peeled & sliced 
       1 medium onion, chopped 
       1/2 cup split peas 
       1 cup frozen yellow corn 
       2/3 cup canned roasted red pepper, diced 
       1/2 cup tomato sauce 
       1/2 cup shelled pistachios 
       1/2 cup roasted almonds 
       1/2 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley 
       1/4 cup lemon juice 
       1/4 cup butter 
       3 tablespoons sugar 
       1/2 teaspoon curry powder 
       1/2 teaspoon pepper 
       1/4 teaspoon thyme 
       1 bay leaf 
       1 dash marjoram 
       1 dash nutmeg 

                    

       Combine all ingredients in a large pot over high heat. 
       Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours or until
soup has reduced by more than half, and is thick and brownish in color. It
should
       have the consistency of chili. Stir occasionally for the first few
hours, but stir often in the last hour. The edges of the potatoes should
become more
       rounded, and the nuts will soften. Serve hot. Makes 4-6 servings.
