This soup tastes even better if made the day before you plan to serve it. Leftovers make a great lunch. To make this soup low in fat leave out the
initial sauteing of the vegetables in butter or oil.  Instead just add the vegetables to the chicken broth (refrigerate the canned broth, use a punch type opener, and the fat will stay in the can).

3 tablespoons unsalted butter or vegetable oil
1 small onion, minced
3 large leeks (white and tender green), cut into 1/2" thick slices
1/2 large carrot, peeled and coarsely chopped
1 small celery rib, coarsely chopped
1 medium red pepper, coarsely chopped
4 cups chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
2 medium all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2" cubes
1 can (19 ounces) white kidney beans, drained and rinsed.
1 tablespoon fresh basil, chopped
Freshly grated parmesan cheese

Heat butter in a large saucepan.  Add onion, leeks, carrot, celery and red pepper.  Cook on medium heat until the vegetables are lightly browned and
softened, about 5 minutes.  Add the broth, salt and pepper.  Simmer for 5 minutes.  Add the potatoes and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about
15 minutes.  Add the white beans and basil and simmer 1 to 2 minutes more. Serve hot. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Serves 6.
