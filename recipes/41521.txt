Select flat-bottomed peppers that can stand upright. 

4 large red bell peppers
2 tablespoons butter
2 jalapeno chilies, seeded and minced
1 leek (white part and 1" of green), sliced
2 teaspoons fresh oregano or 1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon fresh basil
1/4 cup cornmeal
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
3 egg yolks
salt and pepper to taste
5 egg whites

Slice tops off peppers.  Finely chop tops, then remove core and seeds. In a heavy skillet over medium heat, melt butter and saute chopped pepper,
chilies and leek until tender, about 3 minutes. Add oregano, basil and polenta and cook for 1 minute.  Add milk and stir.  Bring mixture to a boil
and simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool for a few minutes before adding cheese and egg yolks.  Stir until incorporated.  Season with
salt and pepper. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Stir 1/4 egg whites into vegetable mixture, then stir resulting mixture into remaining
egg whites.  Place peppers in a 8 inch square baking pan and spoon filling evenly into each. They can be refrigerated at this point for several hours.
Bake in a 375 degree oven for 35 minutes until brown and puffed. Serves 4 (or 8 if you cut the peppers in half).
