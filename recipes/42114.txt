Whether you use ground beef as your meat base or some mixture of ground beef with veal, pork, or lamb, add the following: 

1 grated carrot, 3 tablespoons grated onion, 1 egg, a large splash of whole milk, a few tablespoons of ketchup, and approximately 1 cup of finely ground Cheerios. Yes, Cheerios! They not only enhance the texture of your loaf, they also add a heap of extra nutrition. 

(If you want the loaf even fuller, you can also soak a slice or two of French bread in the milk before adding it.) 

Mix it all thoroughly, and chill it for a half hour before forming it into a loaf.
