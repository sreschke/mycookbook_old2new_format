SALMON PATE 
 
2 c cooked, boneless, skinless salmon 
1/4 to 1/2 c heavy cream 
2 tbs lemon juice, or to taste 
1 tbs chopped fresh dill, plus more for garnish (optional) 
salt and pepper to taste 

Place the fish in the container of a food processor or blender. Add about 1/4 cup of cream and blend. Gradually add more cream until desired consistency is reached, taking care the mixture does not become too liquid. Stop the blending at intervals and scrape down the sides of the container with a plastic spatula. When properly blended, the mass should be mousse-like, holding its shape when picked up with the spatula. Spoon and scrape the mixture into a bowl and add the lemon juice, dill, salt and pepper. Spoon the pƒt‚ into a serving dish, such as a small souffl‚ mold. Cover and chill well, preferably overnight. Garnish, if desired, with chopped dill. Serve with matzo. 
Serves 4 to 6.
