Garlic Prawns (large prwans or Mozambique prawns)
Peel the raw prawns and cut them to remove the fine digestive cord.  Wash them and pat them dry with paper towels. Slice the prawns a bit to open and flat them; season with salt and piri-piri - it's very hot (malagueta, or african pepper, you can use chilli pepper).
In a frying pan, pour olive oil and crushed garlic cloves; let brown just a little (light golden brown). add prawns and let fry in low heat for 5 minutes. Sprinkle with snipped coriander (cilantro) leaves and serve immediately, with french fries and lettuce with tomato salad.
This recipe is a must in Mozambique parties but also in restaurants,outdoor cafâ€š's and terraces. My mother in law doesn't know the ingredients rigth amounts, she says she fryed by memory and that's very easy to do it.
Good luck.
