1-2# beef (round steak, sirloin steak, or stew meat), cut in 1 in. pieces
2 cans cream of mushroom soup
2 cans french onion soup (I occasionally substitute a Lipton onion soup
mix, mixed with water)
2 cans sliced mushrooms

Put everything in the crockpot, give it a stir and let it cook on low
--all day or until the meat is super-duper tender! Serve over noodles or
rice. For a little extra zing--serve with a dollop of sour cream. Yummy!
