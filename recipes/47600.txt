8 slices good-quality white bread
6 to 8 tablespoons jam, strawberry, raspberry or your choice
4 teaspoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
 confectioners' sugar
 Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Meanwhile prepare sandwiches. Spread 4 slices of bread with jam, using 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons jam on each. Top each with remaining slices of bread. Spread 1 side of each sandwich with 1/2 teaspoon of butter. Place sandwiches in skillet, butter side down. (You may have to cook these in batches.) Spread plain sides of sandwiches with remaining butter. Cook until bottomed side is browned, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until other side is browned. Allow these to cool for a few minutes before serving, jam will be VERY hot at first. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, cut each sandwich into quarters diagonally and serve.
