1 8 oz. package cream cheese, at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 loaf French bread
2 tablespoons butter

 Beat cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer until smooth. Blend in vanilla, sugar and strawberry jam. Set aside. Mix together eggs and cream or milk. Set aside. Slice French bread into slices about 1 1/2 inches thick, discarding ends. Using a small sharp knife, make a small slit in the bottom of a bread slice. Work the tip of the knife back and forth to create a pocket without cutting through the sides. Place the cream cheese filling in a large zip-loc bag and cut off 1 corner of the bag. Pipe the filling into each of the bread pockets. Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip each slice of bread in the egg-milk mixture and turn to coat both sides. Cook the French toast in the skillet until just browned, about 3 minutes per side. Do not crowd the pan. It may be necessary to do this in batches. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve immediately passing syrup on the side.
