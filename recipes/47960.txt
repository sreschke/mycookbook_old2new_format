2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil
1 pork tenderloin, preferably peppercorn marinated, (1-1 1/4 lbs), cut into 1-inch cubes
6 to 8 button mushrooms, sliced
1/2 large onion, thinly sliced
1 1/2 cups quick-cooking barley
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon sage
2 1/2 to 3 cups chicken broth
 salt & freshly ground black pepper

 Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork and saute until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate with a slotted spoon. Add 1 tablespoon more oil if necessary. Add mushrooms and saute until browned and softened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to the plate with the reserved pork. Add remaining oil to the skillet. Saute onions until softened, about 5 minutes. Add sage, thyme and barley. Stir to coat barley with herbs and oil. Return pork and mushrooms to the skillet. Stir to combine ingredients. Pour 2 1/2 cups chicken broth over. Bring to a boil. Stir and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer 15 minutes. Check for doneness. If barley is still a little too firm, add remaining chicken broth and cook 5 minutes more. Stir well before serving.
