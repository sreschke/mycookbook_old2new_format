Start in the morning.. Slice half of onion in bottom of crockpot.. Add ribs.. Add remaining sliced onion.. Cover ribs with water and cook on high until tender.. Drain water, add BBQ sauce and cook on low till you are ready to eat it!! 

I just made this last night.. The meat falls apart and is easly shredded for serving on hamburger buns or can be spooned onto what ever you want!! It was delicious!!
