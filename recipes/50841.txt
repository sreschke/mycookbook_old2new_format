3 t. (1 T.) baking powder
1/2 t. salt
2 c. unbleached white four (or 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1 c. white flour)
4 T. shortening (or 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening)
1 c. milk

Blend all dry ingredients in a bowl.  Using a pastry cutter, cut in shortening until crumbly-coarse.  Make a well in the center of coarse mixture, add milk and stir until the dough follows the fork or spoon around the bowl.  Dough will be sticky.

Turn out onto lightly floured surface and, using extra flour on hands, knead VERY gently for 15 to 30 seconds.  Pat or roll dough out evenly to about 1/2" thick.  Cut with floured biscuit cutter and place on ungreased baking sheet.  Bake at 450 for 15 minutes or until tops are just lightly browned.
