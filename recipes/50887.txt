GRILLED TANDOORI CHICKEN PIECES

  2         cups  plain yogurt
  1         tablespoon  ginger -- freshly grated
  1         tablespoon  garlic -- minced
  2         teaspoons  paprika
  2         teaspoons  kosher salt
  1-1/2   teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1         teaspoon  ground cumin
  1         teaspoon  ground coriander
  1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground pepper
  1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  3         pounds  chicken pieces
             Vegetable oil

In a large bowl, combine the yogurt and next 9 ingredients. Mix well and set
aside. Rinse the chicken pieces and pat dry. Using a sharp knife, make
1/2-inch-deep scores in the chicken meat at 1-inch intervals. Add the
chicken pieces to the marinade and coat well, working the marinade into the
cuts. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or as long as 12 hours.
Lightly brush cooking grate with vegetable oil. Scrape most of the marinade
from the chicken pieces. Grill them indirectly over medium heat, turning
occasionally, until the meat is opaque throughout and the juices run clear.
Breasts will take about 45 minutes, while drumsticks will take about 1 hour.
Serve warm.  Yield: 6 servings.
