In a large bowl, combine flour and baking powder, salt and baking soda.  Cut in spread until mixture is crumbly.  Add buttermilk, stirring until mixture forms a soft dough.  Place dough onto lightly floured surface.  Knead lightly 3-4 times.  Roll out dough to 1/2 inch thickness.  With floured 1  3/4 inch biscuit cutter, cut out biscuits, rerolling scraps if necessary to form 18 biscuits.  Place 1 inch apart on lightly greased baking sheet.  Bake at 425 for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.
