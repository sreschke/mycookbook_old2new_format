2 large Idaho potatoes
1/4 c. butter
milk or rice milk
salt and pepper
1 - 2 T. chopped green onions (optional)
grated cheese (optional)

Bake potates in preheated 425-degree oven until soft, about 60 minutes.  (Or microwave for 6 - 10 minutes at high.)  Let cool slightly.  Slice off the top of the potatoes, to create a boat-like shape.  Gently scoop the pulp from the skin, taking care not to tear the skin.

Combine the potato pulp, butter, salt and pepper with a potato masher or mixer.  Add enough liquid to make a creamy (lumps are OK) paste.  Add the onions and/or cheese at this point.

Heap the potato mixture back into the potato shells.  Sprinkle with extra cheese and place under broiler until lightly browned (about 10 minutes).
