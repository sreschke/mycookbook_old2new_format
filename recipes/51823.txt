
2 large boxes sugar free jello (.6 oz each)(I like to use Orange,but you can use lemon or lime)
Mix jello according to package directions, I usually use ice cubes as it is faster, instead of water.
Drain l Can (20 oz) Crushed Pineapple in it's own juice.
2 Cups low fat (2%) cottage cheese
l Carton Lite Whipped Topping (8 or l2 oz)
When jello is starting to set up add the above ingredients and beat until mixed with a hand electric mixer.
This a good low cal and fat salad that tastes excellent. I put it in a large tupperware mixing bowl or glass bowl. Ready to eat when set up
