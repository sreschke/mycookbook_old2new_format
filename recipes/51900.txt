I rarely use the exact ingredients, it depends on what kind of salad greens are available - and I often leave out the sprouts.

Prepare the salad:
In a large bowl, combine lettuce, spinach, sprouts, and cilantro.  Drop asparagus into boiling water and boil for 3-4 minutes or until it turns bright green.  Remove from boiling water and immediately rinse in cold water.  Drain.  Add chicken, asparagus and carrots to salad greens and toss.

Dressing:
2 T. olive oil
1 T. fresh lemon juice
1-2 T. mayonnaise
1 t. honey
1/2 t. curry powder
1/2 t. basil
1 t. green onions, finely sliced
Salt and pepper to taste

In a small bowl, combine oil, lemon juice, mayonnaise and honey.  Whisk until creamy.  Add curry, basil, onions and salt/pepper.  Whisk again.  Pour over salad and toss gently.  Serve.
