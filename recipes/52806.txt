Alexis Stewart developed this chocolate-chip cookie recipe for her mother, Martha, when she was 12 years old. Best enjoyed with a cold glass of milk, these flat, buttery cookies have a perfect combination of crunchiness and chewiness. Use an ice-cream scoop to make evenly sized cookies. If cookies harden before you have a chance to remove them from the baking sheet, return the sheet to the oven for a few seconds to soften the dough for easier removal.
