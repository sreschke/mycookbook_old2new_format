2 c all purpose flour
2 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp baking powder
« tsp baking soda
« tsp salt
« cup butter (I use butter flavour Crisco ? more heart smart)
« cup raisins (I add chopped apricots sometimes)
? c buttermilk (don?t substitute ? it makes a difference)

Combine first five ingredients in large bowl.  Cut in butter with pastry blender or two knives until crumbly.  Stir in raisins.

Add buttermilk to flour mixture, stirring just until moistened.  Dough will be crumbly.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface.  Knead lightly 12-15 times or until a smooth ball forms.  ** Form into a fat log and curve it until the ends touch ? like a big donut with just a small middle opening (**These are my instructions because as one big round loaf, the centre never cooks before the outside browns; this way it is not one solid mass. But it expands into a round when baking anyway) Place on lightly greased baking sheet.   With sharp knife, score top of dough a few times.

Bake at 425 for 10 minutes or so, then reduce heat to 350 and bake another 20-30 minutes.  (The original directions baked it at 425 for 20-25 minutes, but that was never long enough in my experience)
