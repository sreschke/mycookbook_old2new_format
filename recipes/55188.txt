BBQ Sauce
Not only is Janet's sauce delicious; it doesn't need any cooking. This is more sauce than you will need for 6 servings, but it keeps for about 6
months in the refrigerator. It's great on chicken, too. 

4 cups (40 ounce size makes 4 cups) Ketchup 
1-1/2 tablespoons red chili powder (ground chilies), available at specialty
markets and some supermarkets
1/2 tablespoon ground allspice 
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin  
2-1/2 tablespoons worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon Tabasco
2 12-ounce beers
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Whisk all ingredients together in a large bowl.  Keep covered in the refrigerator until needed. Makes 6 cups.

Ribs:
Country ribs aren't really ribs at all but pork chops that come from the end of the pork loin, but there's a lot more finger lickin' good meat to
eat with these ribs. If you don't have a water smoker, place them directly on the rack of the grill set over medium heat, cover, and grill for about 2 hours, basting and turning every 15 minutes or so.

4 pounds country ribs
2 cups barbecue sauce

Preheat a water smoker.  Add presoaked hickory or mesquite chunks to the heat source.  Put the water pan in place and fill the pan with water. 
Place the ribs on the highest food grid.  Cover and smoker-cook, keeping the temperature between 200 and 225 degrees, about 2-1/2 to 3 hours, or
until tender. The ribs can be made a day ahead up to this point. Baste the ribs with sauce, then grill covered, over medium heat, turning often and
basting  with more sauce, until crisp, about 15 minutes per side.
