This warm, gooey dessert with a deep chocolate flavor is contrasted with cold vanilla ice cream. 
 
4 ounces semi-sweet chocolate
8 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
pinch of salt
1/2 cup cocoa powder
4 large eggs, at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup sugar
confectioners' sugar

Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Place chocolate and butter in a small saucepan and place over low heat until almost melted. Remove from heat and let cool,
stirring occasionally.  Sift together twice all the dry ingredients except sugar.  Set aside. Beat eggs and vanilla until foamy and light.  Add sugar
and beat until fluffy. Stir in chocolate mixture.  Fold in dry ingredients. Coat 6 1/2-cup custard cups or ramekins with cooking spray and pour in
batter, filling each nearly to rim.  Bake for 15-20 minutes or until brownies have risen to just above the rim and tops are firm.  The centers
should look moist and shiny. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve immediately with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Makes 6.
