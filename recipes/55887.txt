15 large cans Libby's pumpkin 
10 lbs onions (big bag)
5 lbs carrots
5 quarts chicken broth
3 lbs very good, lean bacon (need this much to make sure it is ok ;^}
1-2 sticks butter
liquid smoke, salt, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, 

good knife, snorkel mask, cuisamatic, can opener, apron, gloves, foil, veg peeler.

Set bacon to bake in *** oven on foil.  Peel carrots, leave whole, simmer in chicken broth, but leave firm...they turn soft quickly.
   Peel, chop up onions, grind real fine in cuismatic, using mask for fumes.  
   Bacon is done, drain fat into cauldrons, add enough butter for softening onions, set them to soften, real soft, at least 20 min.   Start adding pumpkin and broth, from carrots, and boxes, plus all seasonings.  Stir and taste. 
 Crumble up bacon very fine, after breaking off the big fatty parts, which look gross in the soup (put in baggie and smush and/or use rolling pin),  and add.  Dice carrots, add when soup is done, which it is fairly quickly, just needs the flavors to meld.  Add water to get a proper consistency.    Tricks:  set outside to cool, or leave a bit too thick and add large
chunks of ice.  Use a gravy-ladle-like cup to fill baggies.  The expensive stand-up ones don't work all that well.  Have moist paper towels handy to clean the baggie closures.
