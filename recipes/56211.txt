2 1/4 teaspoons salt   
1/4   cup plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil   
1     lemon   
8     baby artichokes   
1     medium shallot, minced (3 tablespoons)   
1/4   cup grainy mustard   
1/4   teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   
3     tablespoons red-wine vinegar   
 
 1. Fill a stockpot with water; add 2 teaspoons salt and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Halve lemon; squeeze juice into water. Add squeezed halves. Remove tough outer leaves from artichokes, and pare down stems using a vegetable peeler. Add artichokes to lemon water, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer; cook until leaves are easily removed and heart is tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain in a colander; set aside.   
 
 2. Place 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat; add minced shallot. Cook until translucent, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; add mustard, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, the pepper, and vinegar. Slowly whisk in remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Serve the reserved artichokes with the warm vinaigrette on the side for dipping.
