Stir in broth, water, onion, beans, and carrots. Bring mixture to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer 5 minutes. Meanwhile, for dumplings, in a medium mixing bowl stir together miscuit mix, cormean, and cheese. Stir in milk just until mixture is moistened. Drop batter onto the hot liquid, making 8 dupmlings. Return to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted into a dumpling comes out clean. Do not lift cover while simmering.
