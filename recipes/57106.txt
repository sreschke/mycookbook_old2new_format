4 Large Eggs
2 Pints Heavy Cream
2 Pints Milk
1 Cup Firmly Packed Light Brown Sugar
1 Tablespoon Vanilla Extract
1 French Baguette (or 10 slices of white bread with crust removed)

Method: Butter or grease the sides of a 9-inch baking dish. Remove the outside crust and cut the bread into quarters. If using a baguette, cut the bread in half, stand it up and cut the outside away. Cut bread into large cubes and place in a bowl. Place egg yolk in a mixing bowl and whisk together. In a medium saucepan combine heavy cream, milk, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Bring mixture to a boil over medium heat. Remove the pan from heat. Set aside and let cool to 80 degrees (warm to the touch with your finger). Whisk the eggs into the mixture. Pour over the bread and mix together gently so the bread is completely soaked. Place in the greased baking dish. Cover with foil. Place baking dish in another dish and add water to the dish (essentially water bath) until it is halfway up the sides. Place in preheated 350-degree oven. Bake for 40- minutes remove foil and lower oven to 325 and bake for 10 minutes more or until the tip of a knife is stuck in the center and it comes back clean.
