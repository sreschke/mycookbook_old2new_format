1 cup sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1 cup dry-roasted peanuts
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon butter or margarine
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda

In a 1 1/2 quart microwave-safe bowl, stir together the sugar, syrup, peanuts, and salt, mixing well. Microwave on high for 6 1/2 minutes. (Times will vary depending on microwave wattage. This recipe is based on an 850-watt oven). Carefully swirl the butter or margarine and vanilla extract into the mixture; don't stir. Microwave for another 30 seconds. The peanuts should be light brown, the syrup will have darkened slightly, and the mixture will be very hot (300 degrees on a candy thermometer). Add baking soda and gently stir the mixture until it's light and foamy. Pour it onto a lightly buttered cookie sheet. (TIP: For a thinner brittle, first warm the sheet in the oven). Let the brittle cool for 30 mins to 1 hour, then break it into small pieces. MAKES 2 POUNDS

NOTES

This recipe came from the December/January 2001 issue of Family Fun. This is a new family favourite and an inexpensive but much loved gift.  It is truly the easiest recipe I've ever tried and is also very rewarding...it turns out right every time!
