3 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 3 pounds total), split and trimmed of fat 
2 cups milk 
4 cups all-purpose flour, sifted 
6 large eggs, beaten 
6 cups unseasoned dry bread crumbs

2 cups Mark Strausman's Tomato Sauce , warmed

           1. Using a meat tenderizer or a heavy skillet, pound chicken  breasts between two sheets of plastic until flat, about 1/4 inch in          thickness. Place milk, flour, eggs, and bread crumbs in separate shallow baking dishes. Season the eggs with a pinch of salt. Dip each breast in the following order: milk, flour (shake off excess), eggs, and bread crumbs (press down firmly while coating with  bread crumbs). 


           2. In a large skillet, melt butter with olive oil over medium-high  heat until sizzling. Arrange chicken breasts in the pan without     crowding, cooking in batches if necessary. Reduce the heat, and  cook the chicken until golden brown and the juices run clear when poked with a sharp fork, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove to a        baking sheet lined with paper towels; pat off excess oil. 

           3. Place 1/2 cup of the warm tomato sauce in the bottom of a 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking dish. Add 3 of the cooked breasts to the        baking dish; cover with 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce and half the  sliced mozzarella. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts and  sauce, and top with mozzarella. Transfer to broiler, and broil until the cheese is melted and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from the broiler, and serve immediately.
