To Make the Chicken: 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Spray a large skillet with no-stick spray; heat. Meanwhile, coat both sides of the chicken with the flour. Shake off any excess flour. Add the chicken to the hot skillet and brown on both sides. Transfer the chicken to an 8-by-8-by-2-inch baking dish; set aside. 

To Make the Sauce:

 Drain the pineapple, reserving the juice. Transfer the juice to a 2-cup measuring cup. Add enough water to make 1 1/4 cups. In a medium saucepan, use a wire whisk to stir together the juice mixture, sugar, vinegar, cornstarch, soy sauce, ginger and bouillon granules. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Slightly reduce the heat and gently boil for 4 minutes, stirring often. Pour half of the sauce mixture over the chicken. Arrange the pineapple slices and pepper rings on top. Then pour on the remaining sauce mixture. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until the chicken is tender and no longer pink. If desired, serve with the rice.
