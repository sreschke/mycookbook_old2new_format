Chuckwagon Soup

3 Tbsp. vegetable oil
2 lbs. beef round, trimmed & cut into 1/2 pieces
2 med potatoes cut small
1 large onion, chopped
2 medium carrots, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 Tbsp. chili powder
1 Tbsp. dried oregano
7 cups of beef stock, homemade or low-sodium
1 (28-0z.) can tomatoes, drained & chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 (16 oz.) can pinto beans, drained
1/2 cup (2 oz.) elbow macaroni 

In a large soup pot, heat 2 Tbps. of the oil over medium-high heat.
Working in batches to avoid crowding, cook the beef until browned on all sides, about 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate. Heat the remaining oil in the pot. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring often, until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes.
Add the chili powder and oregano and stir for 1 minute. Add the browned beef, stock, tomatoes, and parsley and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat
to low and simmer, partially covered, to blend the flavors, about 1 hour.
Add the beans and macaroni and increase the heat to high. Cook, uncovered,
until the macaroni is tender, about 10 minutes. Serve hot.  --
Enjoy!
