Several heads of lettuce torn into small pieces - Iceberg, Curly Endive, and Romaine
3 large tomatoes, washed and cut into medium chunks
8 ounces (about 1 cup) part-skim feta cheese. Cut in cubes, if possible.
1/2 cup Greek olives; or 1 can large black olives marinated in olive oil and garlic overnight.
1/2 cup sliced green onion
1 can anchovy fillets, drained thoroughly. I like to use the flat ones for this recipe.


Dressing to be made the night before:


2/3 cup olive oil
Several garlic cloves, crushed
1/4 cup wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon oregano



Combine all the dressing ingredients in a jar with a lid. Mix several times until everything is well blended. Refrigerate overnight and allow to come to room temperature 2 hours before using. Remove garlic, if desired.

Using a large bowl or serving platter, which I like to use, assemble all the above ingredients in your most "artistic" fashion. Pour the dressing over all. Dive in and drink your hearts out for the rest of the night!

SUGGESTION: Many people use potato salad in this recipe. You can mound your potato salad under the lettuce and it becomes quite a surprise! You can also stuff your tomato shells with potato salad and surround it on a bed of lettuce with cheese, olives and anchovies . . . a very unique lunch dish.
