1. Remove the twine that is bound around the pork loin. The loin should be in halves now. If it is not, cut through loin to within 1/4 inch of edge.
2. Combine the onion, 1 clove garlic, basil, parsley, 1/4 tsp. each salt and black pepper. Spread over the inside of the pork.
3. Tie together with twine, keeping as much of the herb mixture as possible inside the loin.
4. In a small bowl, combine the oil, lemon juice, remaining garlic, salt, pepper and thyme. Spread the mixture over the exterior of the pork roast. Allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, if possible.
5. Roast on a rack in an uncovered shallow roasting pan at 350øF. for 35 - 45 minutes per pound, or until a meat thermometer registers 170øF. Let sit 5 minutes before serving. 

Good served with: Wild rice or brown rice pilaf, buttered peas and crisp rolls. Sliced oranges for dessert.
