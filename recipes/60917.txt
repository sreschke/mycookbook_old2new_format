This Moroccan recipe is best when you use "fancy" zucchinis (courgettes). They are smaller than ordinary zucchinis and have a dark green outer skin which should be blemish free. 
 
Makes 5 servings
 
8 whole fancy zucchini about 1 1/2" in diameter and 6 to 7" long 
1/4 teaspoon turmeric 
1 dash salt 
2 tablespoons oil 
1 1/4 pounds lean ground chuck 
1 large onion 
1/4 cup parsley loosely packed 
1 whole egg 
1 teaspoon mace 
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 
1/4 cup matzo meal 
2 tablespoons oil 
1/4 cup water 
salt and pepper to taste 
 
Wash zucchini and peel stripes along the ridges. Remove and discard ends and cut zucchini into 1/4" pieces. Place in the bottom of a 4 to 5 quart Dutch oven. Sprinkle with turmeric and salt, cover and simmer over low heat. Check zucchini often, shaking or swirling contents of pot to prevent from sticking to bottom. Add 1/4 cup of water if 
necessary to prevent this. The zucchini will release their own juices as they cook. Simmer for about 30 minutes. 

Meanwhile: Peel onion, quarter and chop in the food 
processor along with the parsley. Add the ground chuck to the processor and pulse long enough to mix with the onion. 
Add the egg, mace, nutmet, matzo meal, oil and salt and pepper. Pulse again to mix all of the ingredients. Add water and pulse again to mix well. The meat mixture should be firm enough to form into meatballs. 

Remove the meat mixture from the food processor. Check the zucchinis. By this time they should have released enough water so that the meatballs will cook in their juices. 
Form meatballs (about 16 in all) and drop one by one onto the cooking zucchini. Cover and cook on medium heat. After 10 minutes, check the meatballs and gently turn over with a spoon or fork. Add 2 tablespoons of oil to the pot, swirl or shake pot to resettle ingredients and continue cooking for 30 minutes or until juice cook into a light 
sauce.
