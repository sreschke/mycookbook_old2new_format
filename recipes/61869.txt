
These drumsticks can be baked early in the day then placed under the broiler just before serving. Line your baking pan with foil for easier
cleaning later.

1/2 cup honey mustard
2 garlic cloves 
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1-1/2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce
1 teaspoon paprika
8 chicken drumsticks, skin slashed at 1/2-inch intervals

Combine all ingredients except chicken in a small bowl and mix well.  Dip each drumstick in the sauce and arrange in a shallow baking dish.  Pour any
extra sauce over the chicken.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 or up to 48 hours.  Return chicken to room temperature before
baking.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake the chicken for about 35 minutes, or until the outside is browned and the juices run clear when the
thickest part of the leg is pierced to the bone. If skin is not brown and crisp, place under the broiler for a few minutes. Serve hot or at room
temperature.  Serves 4.
