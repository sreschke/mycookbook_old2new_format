1 10oz bag coconut flakes
1 10 1/2oz bag colored mini marshmallows
1 12oz bag semi-sweet chocolate chips
wax paper

Begin by melting the whole bag of chocolate.  Let the chocolate cool enough so that it does not melt the marshmallows.  When cool, mix in the marshmallows until they are completely covered with chocolate.  

Next, sprinkle coconut over a sheet of wax paper (about 10 inches long).  Spoon out the marshmallow/chocolate mixture onto the coconut and roll up.  Twist the ends of the wax paper.  

Freeze rolls for about an hour then slice to see the beautiful "church windows".
