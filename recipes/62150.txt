Preheat oven to 350Ã¸F. Line 9 1/2-cup muffin-tin cups with paper liners. In a small bowl, lightly whisk together yolks, 1/8-cup milk and vanilla. In an electric mixer bowl, combine dry ingredients and mix on low speed for 30 seconds to blend.  Add butter and remaining milk.  Mix on low speed until dry ingredients are moistened.  Increase to medium speed and beat for 1 1/2 minutes to aerate and develop cupcakes' structure.  Scrape down sides and gradually add egg mixture in three batches, beating for 20 seconds after each addition.  Scrape down sides.  Divide batter among 9 paper lines, filling them about 2/3 full, and bake about 20 to 25 minutes or until a tester inserted in the center of one cupcake comes out clean.  Cool cupcakes for a few minutes in tin on a rack and then remove cupcakes and cool completely on rack before frosting.
