Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and at least 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon together in a large mixing bowl. In a small mixing bowl, combine the beaten egg, milk, and melted butter. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients and blend well. Fold in the apples. 
In another small mixing bowl or cup, combine the sugar and cinnamon topping for the muffins and set aside. 
Drop muffin batter by tablespoonfuls into the prepared muffin tin, filling each well about two-thirds full. Sprinkle each muffin with the cinnamon-sugar topping and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden. Let the muffins cool in the tin for 5 to 10 minutes before removing them to a wire rack to complete cooling.
