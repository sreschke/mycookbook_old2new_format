  Preheat your grill on high for the chicken. When the grill is hot,
rub each chicken piece with oil and cook the chicken for 4 to 6

pieces into a large frying pan over medium heat. Heat until chicken
sizzles then reduce heat and cover chicken until ready to serve.
Spoon chicken into a medium bowl, then pour all the sauce over the
chicken and stir until well-coated. Serve with steamed white rice.
