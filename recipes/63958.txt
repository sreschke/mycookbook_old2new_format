 I also make
           slushies using fruit flavored syrup, but my all-time ever favorite is home-made cool-atta. To make this, I shave a tub of ice. In a
           blender, I add 2 TBS instant sugar-free vanilla pudding, 1 tsp instant coffee granules, Â« cup 2% milk, and 1 packet of Splenda. I
           blend it until it's mixed and then add my shaved ice, give it a couple of pulses and it's ready to drink...it's so creamy and cold,
           great on a hot summer's day. I use sugar-free because I'm diabetic, but you could use regular sweetened pudding, sugar and whole
           milk or half and half, if you're not restricted in any way diet-wise.
