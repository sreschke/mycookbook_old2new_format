Take either canned or frozen green beans. (You can use fresh too, but it takes an hour or so longer). Cover with water. Add a
           bullion cube for each can or package of beans (I have been using the chicken base - a half of teaspoon as you would bullion), a
           couple of slices of onion (or 1 teaspoon dried onion), a slice of bacon or bacon grease. Salt and pepper to taste, and bring to a boil.
           Boil for a minute, then reduce heat and simmer gently checking on them often for about half an hour. 

           Yummy! And eat them "Martha" style - spoon them on your plate, and add some diced fresh tomato and onion. Toss to mix. That
           is how she ate hers, I can still smell it. 

           I use frozen green beans, and as far as canned, I like the Green Giant kitchen sliced beans. I love their texture.
