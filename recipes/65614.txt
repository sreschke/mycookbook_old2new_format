Bake turkey. Baste with water, salt, pepper and 1/4lb butter. Roast until done. Remove meat from the bones. While still warm cut into bite size pieces. Measure 10 cups of broth. Melt 1/2lb butter and the velveeta cheese in broth. Pour over warm turkey, place into crock pot to serve on buns. Freezes well. Will make 2 (5 quart) pails full. This is also very good made with chicken.
