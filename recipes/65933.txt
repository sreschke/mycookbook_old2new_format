Wind bacon around cheese-stuffed knockwurst then grill. Serve in buns and accompany with chips and relishes. 


5 fully cooked knockwurst or fully cooked bratwurst (about 1 pound) 
2 ounces Monterey Jack cheese 
5 slices bacon 
5 French-style rolls or frankfurter buns, halved lengthwise 
Catsup, mustard, and/or pickle relish (optional) 

1. Cut a lengthwise slit in each knockwurst or bratwurst about 1/2 inch deep. Cut cheese into 5 strips that are 2-1/2x1/2x1/4-inches. Insert a cheese strip into each knockwurst. Wrap a slice of bacon around each knockwurst. Fasten the bacon with wooden toothpicks.

2. To grill by indirect heat, in a covered grill arrange preheated coals around a drip pan. Test for medium heat above the pan. Place knockwurst, cheese side up, on the grill rack over the drip pan. Cover and grill for 8 to 10 minutes or until bacon is crisp and cheese is melted.

3. To serve, place knockwurst in French-style rolls or buns. If desired, serve with catsup, mustard, and/or pickle relish. Makes 5 servings.

Make-Ahead Tip: Stuff and wrap sausage with bacon. Cover and refrigerate up to 1 hour ahead of grilling.
