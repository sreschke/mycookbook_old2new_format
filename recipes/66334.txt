Childrens' cooking teacher Denise Owen, originally from Mississippi, lent us her grandma's recipe. Denise says, "it's the best chocolate cake in the
universe." It needs no frosting and will last for a week. This cake is not difficult for older children to prepare, but younger children will need
some help from Mom or Dad.

2 cups sugar
4 eggs, separated
1 cup unsalted butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cocoa, dissolved in 1/4 cup hot water
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cups pecans, chopped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9 x 13" baking pan. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in egg yolks, one at a time, blending
well after each addition. Add flour, cocoa, vanilla, and chopped pecans. Beat egg whites until stiff and fold one-third gently into batter to
lighten mixture; fold in remaining whites. Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan and rap the pan lightly on a work surface to eliminate any air
bubbles. Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake 30 to 35 minutes, until the edges are firm and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out
clean.  Allow cake to cool on a rack. Serve from the pan. Makes about 10 servings.
