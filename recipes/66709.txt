3 cups flour (one cup can be whole wheat)
1/3 cup sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 sticks of butter cut up into cubes - chilled
1 cup of fruit
1 cup of milk (I use buttermilk)
1 tablespoon of cream

Mix the dry ingredients together first, then cut in the butter to the dry mixture until it reassembles oatmeal.  Add the wet ingredients and finally the fruit.  Stir just until the mixture comes together and no more!!!  Knead on a lightly floured board five times.  Shape into a flat circle and using a kitchen knife cut into wedges but don't pull apart.  Bake in a 450 degree oven for 15-20 minutes.

Use any fruit you prefer.  Sometimes I don't add fruit to the mixture, instead using the back of a spoon or my thumb I make a well into each section and fill with jam and then bake.
