I love burgers with barbecue sauce. In this recipe, the barbecue sauce is basically integrated into the burger instead of being put on top. You can also substitute ground pork, chicken, or turkey or a combination. There's no need for ketchup.


2 pounds ground beef

1 bunch scallions, white and green chopped 

Zest of l lemon

3 tablespoons tomato paste

2 to 3 garlic cloves, minced

1 tablespoon brown sugar

1 tablespoon soy sauce

3 to 4 teaspoons chili powder

1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

1/2 teaspoon black pepper

1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt

1 lemon or lime, cut into 6 wedges


Place everything except the salt and lemon in a large bowl and mix well. Divide into 6 patties and sprinkle them with the salt.

Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and, when it is very hot, add the burgers. Be sure to let the pan reheat between additions. Cook until the burgers are deeply browned, about 3 to 5 minutes on each side. (Or, if you prefer, cook on an outdoor grill.) 

Serve immediately, garnished with the lemon or lime sections.

Makes 6 burgers.
