Saute the onions in 4 tablespoons of butter until soft (save the other
2 tablespoons) .   Add shrimp and crabmeat.   Cook until the shrimp
are pink.   While shrimp are cooking, melt the other two tablespoons
of butter in a saucepan.   Add the flour.   Mix throughly.   Cook over
a low heat until bubbly.   Stir in the milk.   Bring to a boil and
cook 1-2 minutes.   This should yield one cup of a white sauce.   Add
the sauce, parsley, mustard, and seasoning.   Mix well. Cook for 3-4
more minutes.   Remove from the heat.   Stir in 1/2 cup cheese.   Pour
into a greased baking dish.   Sprinkle with the remaining cheese, then
with the bread crumbs.   Bake at 400 for 15 minutes.
