Amount Measure Ingredient -- Preparation Method
-------- ------------ --------------------------------
2 1/4 c all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp double-acting baking powder
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 c sugar
1/2 c unsweetened applesauce
2 eggs
1/3 c vegetable oil
2 mashed bananas -- (very ripe)
1/2 c skim milk
1/4 c semisweet chocolate chips

Preheat the oven to 350Ã¸F. Line eighteen muffin cups with paper
liners. These muffins have a tendency to stick, so you may want to spray
paper liners with a little pam before you fill them. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and baking soda. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer at medium speed, beat the sugar,
applesause, eggs and oil until frothy. With the mixer at low speed, alternately add the bananas and milk with the flour mixture; stir until just combined (do not overmix). Fold in the chocolate chips. Spoon the batter into the cups, filling each almost full. Bake until golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 - 25 minutes. Remove from the cups and cool completely on a rack.
