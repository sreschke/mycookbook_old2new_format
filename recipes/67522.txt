A savory recipe that combines Napa cabbage, grainy mustard, garlic, and red-wine vinegar, it satisfies
                      without even a dot of mayonnaise. My friend Susan Herrmann Loomis ran across this recipe while collecting
                      for her French Farmhouse Cookbook (Workman, 1996) and generously shared it with me. I've been eating it
                      ever since.
                      ==========================================================
                      2-1/2 tsp. good quality red-wine vinegar
                      4 tsp. Dijon mustard
                      4 tsp. grainy mustard
                      2 sm. cloves garlic, peeled and minced
                      Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
                      Scant 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
                      1-1/2 lbs. Napa cabbage, trimmed, cut in quarters lengthwise, and very finely sliced crosswise
                      2/3 cup loosely packed Italian parsley leaves, minced
                      4 tsp. hot water
                      ==========================================================
                      1. In large bowl, whisk together vinegar, both mustards, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Slowly add olive
                      oil in thin stream, whisking constantly until dressing is emulsified. Whisk in hot water.

                      2. Add cabbage and parsley to dressing and toss until thoroughly combined. If not serving immediately, you
                      can let it stand up to 2 hours before serving. Toss before serving to redistribute dressing.
                      ==========================================================
                      Serves 8
