Preheat oven to 325ยง. Using electric mixer, beat first 6 ingredients in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs and beat well. Mix flour, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Stir into butter mixture, mixing well. Add chocolate chips and nuts, mix well. Drop by 1/4 cup (I use a little less and roll the dough into balls) and place onto ungreased cookie sheet, leave room for them to spread. Bake until cookies are golden brown about 15 minutes. Transfer to rack to cool. Makes about 3 1/2 dozen.
