Thaw shrimp, if frozen.  If using fresh artichokes, rinse well and trim stems.  Remove the outer leaves; snip off sharp leaf tips about 1/4 inch from top.  Cut artichokes into quarters and dip into lemon juice to prevent browning.  Cut frozen artichokes in half and set them aside.  Cook pasta according to the package directions; drain and return to pan.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet combine artichokes, shallot, broth, thyme, red pepper and 1/4 tsp. salt; heat to boiling.  Reduce heat; simmer, covered, until artichokes are tender.  Allow 8 to 10 minutes for fresh artichokes, 5 minutes for frozen artichokes.  With a slotted spoon, remove artichokes, reserving liquid in skillet.  Add shrimp to skillet and cook, uncovered over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until pink, stirring often.

With a slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to artichoke mixture, reserving liquid in skillet.  Reduce any liquid left in skillet to about 1 Tbs.  Add cream; boil gently 2 to 3 minutes or until thickened, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat; stir in butter and lemon peel until melted.

Stir shrimp-artichoke mixture into sauce; heat through.  Pour the sauce over the pasta and toss gently.  If serving shrimp with tails on, use cooking tongs to arrange them on plate.  Serve with lemon wedges, if desired.
