Puff pastry found in the freezer case at most supermarkets takes all the work out of making this delicious dessert. Peeled sliced peaches may be
substituted for apples.

1/2 17-1/4 ounce package frozen puff pastry
2 medium Golden Delicious or Granny Smith apples
1-1/2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 tablespoons sugar
1/4 cup apricot preserves
1/2 tablespoon water 
Vanilla ice cream (optional)

Thaw puff pastry as label directs.  Unfold 1 puff pastry sheet on floured surface; with floured rolling pin, roll pastry to 14-1/2 inch x 14-1/2 inch square.  Using a 7-inch round plate as guide, cut out 4 rounds from pastry. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Cut 2 apples lengthwise in half; remove cores and peel.  Cut apple halves lengthwise into paper thin slices.  Place pastry rounds on large ungreased cookie sheet; arrange 1/4 of apple slices
in a over-lapping pattern on top, leaving a 1/2" border.  Dot with butter or margarine and sprinkle with sugar.  Bake apple tarts 20 minutes or until
pastry is lightly browned and crisp and apples are tender.  With metal spatula, remove tarts to wire racks. In small saucepan over low heat, heat
apricot preserves and water until melted.  Brush tarts while hot with apricot glaze. Serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream.
Makes 4 tarts.
