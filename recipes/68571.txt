The original recipe was from my pressure cooker cookbook and that's how I made it, but I don't see why it couldn't just be made on the stovetop...you'd simply have to cook it longer.

Anyway:
5 cups sliced strawberries
3 cups sugar (I subbed Splenda for all the sugar)
1 tablespoon Grand Marnier or other orange-flavored liqueur (I did use this - but I'm sure you could omit. If you still wanted a bit of the orange flavor use a tablespoon of orange juice)

Mix the Splenda together with the fruit and let stand 30 minutes to develop juice (I do this in a large plastic container and just give it a good couple of shakes every little bit - easier than stirring!) Mash half the berries (I put mine in the blender) and then mix back together with the remaining slices. Put in pressure cooker, set pressure to High, and cook 6 minutes. Let pressure drop, then continue to cook another 3-6 minutes til the jam will form a "paste" consistency when a spoonful is dropped onto a chilled plate (spread it out quickly on the chilled plate, then scoop it back together...if it holds its shape it's done)

Let cool, then I simply put it into a plastic container then into the fridge. It made about 2 cups. I also made it with 6 cups fresh cherries, pitted and halved (but didn't mash any) and without the liqueur, and made another batch with 6 cups of blackberries too. It was all delicious...DH liked the cherry preserves best (he would, it took me about 45 minutes to pit all those little suckers!) and my favorite was the blackberry. I'm gonna try it with blueberries next.
