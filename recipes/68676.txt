Hubert Sandot, owner and chef of Martinique Bistro in New Orleans, likes to add kumquats to his blueberry-and-blackberry confiture to give it a tart flavor. Kumquats, which look like tiny oval or round oranges, have sweet, edible golden-orange rinds and rather dry, tart flesh-both skin and flesh can be eaten. In Hubert's confiture recipe, all but the ends of the fruit are used.
