1. In a small bowl, combine mushrooms with just enough hot tap water to cover. Allow to sit under softened, at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in another small bowl, combine hoisin sauce, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 teaspoon sesame oil and 1 tablespoon water. Mix well, transfer to a serving bowl, and set aside.

2. Reserve  1/2 cup mushroom soaking liquid, and drain mushrooms. Squeeze out moisture, remove stems, and cut into  1/4-inch dice. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add peanut oil. When it is hot, add the mushrooms; stir briefly. Add tofu, bamboo shoots, scallions, celery and water chestnuts. Add reserved mushroom soaking liquid, oyster sauce, remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce, sugar and salt. Bring sauce to a boil.

3. Add cornstarch mixture, and cook until wok ingredients develop a clear glaze, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, add black pepper, and drizzle with remaining teaspoon sesame oil. Toss to combine.

4. To serve, place vegetable mixture in a bowl in the center of a platte, and surround with lettuce leaves. Pass hoisin sauce separately.
