Ingredients
2 tbs. white wine vinegar OR lemon juice OR lime juice 1 tbs. honey
Parsley to taste Cajun spice mix of choice (can just use cayenne to taste if that's all you have handy) 
Mrs. Dash to taste 
1 tsp. oil (olive oil tastes best) 
2 tsp. soy sauce 
1 tsp. worcestershire sauce 
Optional: half a finely chopped shallot 
1 pound shrimp 

Instructions
1. Put all ingredients except shrimp in a bowl and stir to combine. 
2. Peel shrimp, but leave the tails on. Add shrimp to the marinade and put in the fridge for at least an hour -- to let the marinade soak in. 
3. Heat oven to 450. Coat a baking dish with non-stick spray and add shrimp. 
4. Cook for 10 minutes or until shrimp turn pink -- stir once or twice. 

Special Notes
This is my variation of a WW recipe after trial and error and changing/adding some ingredients -- none of my changes added points.
This is FAST once the shrimp are peeled and tastes great! I like to serve this with french bread (extra points) to dip in the extra sauce that is left.
