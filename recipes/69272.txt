From MMMMiami--Tempting Tropical Tastes for Home Cooks Everywhere by Carole Kotkin and Kathy Martin

My friend Wendy Nattoli gave me the recipe for this easily made Creole dish. It is made with what New Orleans Chef, Paul Prudhomme calls the "holy
trinity" of Creole cooking: chopped onions, celery, and green peppers.  Along with tomatoes, these vegetables are are simmered into a sauce, then
shrimp are sauteed and combined--and that's all there is to it.   The sauce can be made a day ahead and kept in the refrigerator.

2 pounds (21 to 25 per pound) large fresh shrimp
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups coarsely chopped onions
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup coarsely chopped celery
1 coarsely chopped green bell pepper
1 can (28 ounces) canned crushed tomatoes
2 tablespoons chopped basil
1 teaspoon thyme
3 bay leaves
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon chili powder
2 tablespoons minced parsley
2 teaspoons salt 
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 teaspoon sugar
2 thin lemon slices
2 cups hot water
salt and pepper to taste
3 cups cooked white rice

Peel the shrimp and remove the intestinal tract down the back.  Set aside.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large size saucepan and add onion, garlic,
celery and green pepper.  Cook about 5 minutes, stirring often. Do not overcook.  The vegetables should remain crisp. Add tomatoes, basil, thyme,
and bay leaves, cayenne pepper, chili powder, salt, pepper, sugar, lemon slices, and water.  Stir well, then simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.  In
a non-stick skillet, heat remaining 2 tablespoons of oil; add shrimp. 

Sprinkle with salt and pepper, stir, and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes, or until the shrimp turns pink. Add the shrimp
and parsley to the tomato mixture and stir. Adjust seasonings. Cook for 1 minute more. Remove bay leaves and lemon slices.  Serve piping hot with
rice.  Serves 6.
