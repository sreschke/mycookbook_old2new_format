3 1/2 cups sugar
16 small whole peaches, peeled (about 4 pounds)
8 whole cloves
1 cup brandy or peach brandy

In a preserving kettle, combine sugar with 1 cup water. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-high and boil moderately for 3 minutes. 

Add peaches and cloves and return to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until peaches are tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. 

With a plotted spoon, remove peaches from syrup and divide equally amoung 4 hot, 16-ounces, sterilized Mason-type jars. 

Add 2 cloves and 1/4 cup brandy to each jar. 

Increase heat under poaching liquid and boil vigorously for 4 minutes. Fill each jar right to top with liquid and seal immediately. Store in a cool dark place, or alternatively, fill jars, leaving a 1/2 inch headspace, and process for 10 minutes in a boiler water bath. 

Mature for one month before using. 

Serve them whole in pretty goblets and top with unsweetened (or very lightly sweetened) whipped cream and a sprinkle of freshly grated nutmeg. 

*I like to remove the pit before serving them. This probably makes them less authentic, but easier to eat. Good served with pound cake or a plain sugar or shortbread cookie.
