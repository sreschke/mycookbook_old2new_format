Pennsylvania Dutch/Philly Cheese Steak Sandwiches

- Have the butcher at your store slice top round paper thin.  A pound or two makes around eight sandwiches. 
- Purchase a good soft hoagie roll sliced and large enough to hold about a half cup to a cup of meat. 
- Several large onions good for pan cooking. 
- Swiss cheese for the cheese steaks/homemade sauce for the Pennsylvania Dutch (the sauce is what differentiates the good Dutch sandwich). 

Preparation 

- Slice the onions and saut‚ in skillet done. They need to be soft but not chewy. 
- Heat a large skillet with oil and place the meat in the pan. Cook on medium to low heat until brown. Do not over cook. Once brown turn down low. 
- Heat the rolls in the oven at a low temperature just to get them warm. 

Cheese steaks can be served two ways: Melt Swiss or cheddar cheese in a small sauce pan. Place meat in roll, add onions and pour cheese over.  Serve. 

Or, after adding meat and onions place a couple slices of cheese on top and microwave on low just to melt the cheese. Don't use high or med/high.  It will make the roll and the meat tough. 

The sauce is what makes the Pennsylvania Dutch Steak Sandwich. 

1 cup ketchup 
2 tablespoons vinegar 
2 tablespoons Worchester sauce 
1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce 
1/2 cup chopped onion (not the onion saut‚ed to go on the sandwiches) 
1 tsp dry mustard 
1/2 tsp salt 
1/2 cup water 
1 stick of butter/margarine 

Mix all ingredients in a sauce pan and allow to come to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes uncovered. 
Sauce will thicken. If it sticks to a spoon it is too thick, add a bit of water but do make too thin. 

Spoon over meat and onions in the roll to desired amount.
