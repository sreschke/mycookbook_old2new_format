2 cups soap flakes or grated soap 
1 gallon water 
1/4 - 1/2 cup glycerin 
2 cups shampoo or liquid dishwashing detergent 
Scented oil of your choice 

Mix the soap flakes, water and 2 tbsp glycerin in a pot and set over low heat, stirring occasionally until the soap has dissolved. (This liquid soap can be stored in a covered container and used as an all-purpose soap or hand soap in the kitchen.) In a bowl, add 2 cups of this mixture to the rest of the glycerin, shampoo and add a few drops of your scented oil. Put into a quart container and store covered at room temperature. When you're ready to bathe, add about one cup to your tub as it's filling.
