Drunkin' chicken 
This has become a favorite in the New Orleans area. It's simple! 
Drunkin Chicken: 
What you get: A whole cooked chicken; the meat falls off the bones; it is tasty ALL the way through. 
What to do: In a beer can (not lite beer), put 1/2 can of beer and lots of liquid crab boil (or other seasoning). Shove this up the "rear" of the bird. Place the bird in a pan- standing up!. Coat bird with butter (or Marg. ) and cajun seasoning. Put on outdoor grill-low heat. Cook until desired temp. (meat thermometer would help). I put mine in a 350* oven, I used powdered crab boil. I couldn't find Lquid at the time
