1 large onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 1/2 pounds crumbled sausage, sweet or hot
1 large red bell pepper, chopped
1 (28-ounce) jar Muir Glenn tomato sauce
1/2 cup dry red wine

15 ounces part-skim ricotta (about 2 cups)
1 large egg
12 (7 by 3 1/2-inch) no-boil lasagne pasta sheets
12 ounces part-skim mozzarella
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a heavy kettle cook onions and 3 cloves of garlic until softened. Add sausage and bell pepper and cook 2 minutes, breaking up sausage. Add tomato sauce and red wine and remaining garlic. Simmer 10 minutes.

In a bowl lightly beat eggs. In another bowl stir together ricotta, egg, salt and pepper. Grate mozzarella.

Pour 1 cup sauce into a baking dish, 13 by 9 by 2-inches (sauce will not cover bottom completely), and cover with 3 lasagne sheets, making sure they do not touch each other. Spread about 2 cups sauce over pasta. Drop 1/3 of ricotta mixture by spoonfuls onto sauce and gently spread with back of spoon. Sprinkle 1/4 of mozzarella over ricotta mixture. Make 2 more layers in the same manner, beginning and ending with pasta. Spread remaining sauce evenly over top, making sure pasta is completely covered, and sprinkle with Parmesan and remaining mozzarella.

Cover dish tightly with foil, tenting slightly to prevent foil from touching top layer, and bake in middle of oven for 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake lasagne 10 minutes more, or until top is bubbling and golden. Let lasagne stand 5 minutes before serving.
