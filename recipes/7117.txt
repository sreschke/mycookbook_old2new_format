1. To segment the crabs, lift the flat under the crab's body with your thumb.  With a firm hold, pull off the top part of the shall with one hand while holding the body firmly with the other.  Discard the top shell.  Remove and discard the spongy, finger-like white gills on either side of the body.  use a sharp knife to cut each body in half.  Halve again.  Use a nutcracker to crack the large claws (this allows for even, faster cooking and easier removal of the meat).
2. Heat the peanut oil in a wok over medium heat.  Add the garlic, chilli and ginger and cook for 1-2mins or until aromatic.  Add the tomato sauce, chilli sauce, sweet chilli sauce, water and sherry and cook for 3-5mins or until slightly thickened.
3. Add the crab pieces to the sauce, stir well and cook, covered for 10-15mins or until the crab is just cooked through (the meat will be white and no longer transparent when cooked).
4. Stir through the green shallots and corander leaves and serve immediately with the rice.
