(One ingredient) Roast.

Take one roast,at least 2-2 1/2 pounds,(any kind of
roast..beef,pork,chicken,etc) take your favorite spices for that roast
and rub on the meat.  Put into a crockpot in the morning on low, or at
lunchtime on high, and ignore until dinner time.Take out and let rest
for 5 minutes then carve as usual.  Serve with anything you would
like.  This way of cooking makes for a very tender meat.  If using
chicken, the skin will not be crisp, but it will be cooked.
