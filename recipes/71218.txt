boi. Reduce heat, partially cover and simmer 15 minutes, skimming foam from
the surface a few times.

chunks(2 1/2 cups). Add vegetables to pot, return to a boil, reduce heat

stirring occasionally, 5 minutes until thickened.
4. When chicken is cool enough to handle, pull meat off bones and tear in
shreds. Return meat to pot.
5. Cool, then remove 6 cups for the Creamed Chicken over Noodles
