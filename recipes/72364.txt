 Melt the 1/4 c. margarine in a 9" pan. Add cherries mixed with the
 1/2 c. sugar. To make cake, mix the flour, 1/2 c. sugar, baking
 powder, salt, 1 beaten egg, 1/2 c. milk and 3 tablespoons of melted
 shortening.
 Bake about 30 mins in a 400 degree oven. IMMEDIATELY after baking,
 invert and put on a serving plate!
 **This is an old receipe of Jim Turgeon's grandmother. There were no baking
 times, oven temperatures and few measurements in the original receipe!
