---------------------
Heat olive oil in a stew pan over high heat. Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper to taste. Add to pan and brown on both
sides. Add celery, carrot, onion, bayleaf and broth. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer until chicken is tender, about 60 minutes. Remove chicken from pot; cool, remove fat and bones and pull apart into small pieces. Skim excess fat from the broth. Discard the vegetables (or eat as cook's treat). Mix the flour with the water until smooth. Bring the
broth to a slow boil. Add the flour-water paste gradually, stirring rapidly after each addition. Continue until gravy is the desired thickness. Taste for seasoning. Add the chicken and keep warm over very low heat. Meanwhile, make the waffles according to recipe and waffle iron. If necessary, place in a 200 F oven to keep warm. Serve the waffles topped with chicken and gravy. 
NOTE : Make extra waffles; freeze and reheat in the toaster for breakfast. Recipe can easily be doubled using a whole chicken.
