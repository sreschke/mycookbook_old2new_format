1/2 cup butter
1 clove garlic, minced
5 teaspoons Dijon mustard
11/2 cups bread crumbs
1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/3 cup dried parsley flakes
8 chicken breast halves

Dijon sauce:
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1/4 cup mayonaise

Make marinade by melting butter in a saucepan.  Add garlic and saute on medium low heat for 5 minutes.  Blend in Dijon mustard.  Cool enough to touch, but not solidify.  Whip until mixture thickens. 
Mix bread crumbs with parmesan cheese, paprika and parsley.  Dip breasts in marinade, then in crumb mixture, packing crumbs to coat well.  Place chicken on a cookie sheet or in a baking dish.  Preheat oven to 350.  Bake 30 minutes or until done.  This is great served with parsley potatoes and a fresh vegetable of your choice!
