The pot pie topping will probably not use all the biscuits, so you will want to bake the leftovers. They are good on their own or with soups or
chili. 

1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into bits
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup sour cream or plain yogurt
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded, and finely chopped (wash hands well after handling peppers) 

Sift dry ingredients into a large bowl.  Cut in butter with finger-tips or two knives until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add remaining ingredients
and stir to combine. If mixture seems dry, add a little more milk.  Knead once or twice in bowl.  On lightly floured surface, pat dough into 1/2-inch
thickness.  With 2-1/2-inch floured cookie cutter or glass, cut out 12 biscuits. To bake the biscuits on their own for different meal, arrange
them on an ungreased baking sheet; brush lightly with melted butter and bake in a preheated 450 degree oven until puffed and golden, about 15
minutes.
