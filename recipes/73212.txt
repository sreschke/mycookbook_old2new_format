Kathy Cary, chef and owner of Lilly?s, a four-star restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky, learned at an early age from her mother how to make corn cakes. This traditional Southern dish is a wonderful complement to turkey hash, another Southern specialty. Use corn straight off the cob for best results.
