Brown a lb. or so of ground beef, add 1/2 C mayonnaise, 1/2 C sour cream, a can of mushrooms and a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch powder....it's quick and easy stroganoff.  I eat it over cabbage "noodles", .sautâ€šed cabbage that has been cut into wide shreds, then cooked in butter and pepper until al dente.
