2 lbs. ground sirloin (or beef) 
1 tomato, chopped 
1 onion, chopped 
1/2 green pepper, chopped 
1 8oz container either cream or sour cream 
1 cup cheese (any kind works, but I like it with Pepperjack) 
Taco seasoning to taste 

Combine onion, pepper and meat in a pan and cook until meat is done, add remaining items and simmer until cheese is melted, you may add a little water to water it down if you like. 

It sorta comes out like a cheese taco think.....very good. After eating it the 1st time my kids asked it they can eat LC all the time. 

MARK'S NOTE: Variation: Use the lettuce wraps instead of tortillas.
