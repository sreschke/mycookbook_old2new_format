    Recipe courtesy of Bobby Flay

    2 ounces unsweetened chocolate
    6 ounces bittersweet chocolate
    1/4 plus cup plus 2 tablespoons all purpose flour
    1/4 teaspoon baking powder
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    3/4 stick unsalted butter
    3/4 cup sugar
    2 large eggs
    2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    2 teaspoons instant espresso powder (Medaglia Doro)
    1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
    1/2 cup best quality white chocolate chips
    1 1/2 cups toasted pecans, coarsely chopped

    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the chocolate in a medium bowl and place over a pot of simmering water and melt
    completely. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt and set aside. In a bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter and
    sugar. Add eggs, then vanilla and espresso, and beat on high speed for 2 minutes. On low speed beat in the melted
    chocolate mixture until just combined. Fold in the flour mixture with a rubber spatula until just combined. Stir in the chips
    and pecans. Using a small ice cream scoop, scoop the mixture onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, putting 8 cookies on
    each sheet. Bake for 10 to11 minutes. The surface will be dry but the inside will still be soft. It will take no longer than 10 to
    11 minutes so set the timer. Cool on a baking sheet. Best eaten the day they are made. Wrap leftovers well in plastic wrap
    and store in an airtight container
