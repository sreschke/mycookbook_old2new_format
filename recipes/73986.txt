Here's one I have used often. It claims to serve 12, but that's only if you can limit yourselves to one of these...I certainly can't! It's called "Apple Dumplings", but it's actually lookes more like a cinnamon roll...shredded apples rolled inside pastry...yum!

Apple Dumplings

2 cups sugar
2 cups water
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup shortening
2/3 cup milk
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
3 cups apples -- shredded, peeled*

For Sauce: In a large saucepan, combine 2 cups sugar, 2 cups water, butter, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and nutmeg. (I usually sub. extra cinnamon for the nutmeg). Bring to boiling and boil for 5 minutes; set aside. (Should have about 2 cups sauce)

For Dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut in shortening until pea-size. Make well in centre. Add milk, all at once. stir just until moistened. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface 10-12 strokes or until nearly smooth. Roll out to 12x10-inch rectangle.

For Filling: Combine 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon; set aside. Sprinkle apples evenly over dough. Sprinkle with sugar mixture. Roll dough into spiral, starting from a long side. Pinch seam to seal. cut into twelve 1-inch-thick pieces. 

Place in 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Pour sauce over dumplings. Bake in a 350 oven about 50 minutes or until golden.

Description:
""These are not your typical dumplings. They look like cinnamon
rolls, but they're really pastry wrapped around a shredded apple
filling.""
