1 1/2 lb. ground pork
1 1/2 lb. ground ham
1 tsp dry mustard
1 large box of Stove Top Stuffing (2 packages)
3 eggs
1 can pineapple rings in their own juice
1/2 cup + brown sugar
  
      Mix together the pork, ham, and mustard.  Add the Stove Top bread crumbs from all of one package and from 1/2 to 3/4 of the second package.  Do Not add the seasoning packets.   Add the eggs.  Mix well and form into small palm sized loaves and place in a greased cake pan. 
     Drain the juice from the pinapple ring and place the juice into a small bowl.  Set the pineapple rings aside.  Add the brown sugar to the pineapple juice.  Add enough brown sugar to form a semi-thick syrup.  
      Preheat the oven to 350.  Meanwhile pour approx. 1-2 T of the brown sugar mixture over each of the ham loaves being carefull not to drench the loaves otherwise the sauce will burn.  Cover the ham loaves and place in the oven and cook for 20 minutes, basting every so often with the remaining brown sugar syrup.  Remove the cover and bake the loaves 10-15 minutes more or until heated through, basting occasionaly.  Top loaves with 1/2 pineapple ring and enjoy!
