Turkey Roulade  


Recipe courtesy Emeril Lagasse, 2000

1 boneless turkey breast half, about 3 pounds
2 cups Wild Mushroom Stuffing 
10 ounces thick-sliced apple bacon
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 

On a large cutting board, place turkey breast on top of plastic wrap and cut so that it opens up to one large flat piece of even thickness. Cover with additional plastic wrap and pound to an even thickness of just under 1/2-inch. Remove plastic wrap from top of turkey and spread stuffing evenly over middle portion of turkey breast and roll it up, using the plastic wrap to help keep the roll in place. 

On a large piece of parchment paper, lay the slices of bacon down so that they just overlap. The resulting ?blanket? of bacon should be long enough to cover the entire length of the turkey roulade. 

Lift the turkey roulade onto the bacon slices and carefully remove the plastic wrap. Using the parchment as a handle, carefully roll up roulade, ?tootsie-roll? fashion. Twist ends tightly. Place this roll on top of a large piece of aluminum foil and roll entire roulade, paper and all, with the aluminum foil. Crimp ends closed. Bake in a roasting pan with a rack for 1 1/2 hours, or until internal temperature reads 155 F. Let roulade rest for 15 minutes, then slice into 1-inch thick slices and serve alongside WHISKEY- BRAISED APPLE SAUCE and CORN AND WILD RICE PUDDING.
