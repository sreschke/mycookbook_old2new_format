Directions 
1    Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
 
2    Place the beef filet in a small baking dish and spread with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until browned. Remove from pan and allow to cool completely. Reserve pan juices. 
 
3    Melt 2 more tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and mushrooms and saute for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Mix together pate and 2 tablespoons softened butter; season with salt and pepper to taste and spread over top of filet. Top off with onion and mushroom mixture. 
 
4    Roll out the puff pastry dough and place the filet in the center. Fold up and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Make a few slits in the top of the dough, place the filet in a 9x13 inch baking dish and brush with the egg yolk.
 
5    Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 10 to 15 more minutes, or until pastry is a rich, golden brown. Set aside and keep warm.
 
6    Place all reserved juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Add the beef stock and red wine; boil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly reduced. Strain and serve with the filet.
