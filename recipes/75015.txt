Leftover pasta is something Americans tend to throw out. But in Italy, day-old pasta is often used for other recipes. One such dish, invented by the Neopolitans, is spaghetti pie, or "pastira"; think of it as a noodle frittata. Previously cooked spaghetti is combined with two cheeses, eggs, soppressata sausage, heavy cream, and herbs. Baked in a deep cake pan, the cheese binds the pasta together, and the result is a "pie" that slices beautifully. This dish has a creamy, satisfying flavor, and makes an ideal weekend meal.
