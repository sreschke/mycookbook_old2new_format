Prep: 12 min Chill: 8 hr or overnight

2 pkg 10 oz each frozen red raspberries in syrup, thawed (I used 2 pkg 12 oz and it worked fine)
1 can (20 oz) curshed pineapple, packed in juice
1 cup water
2 pkgs (4 serving size each) raspberry flavored gelatin
l cup sour cream, regular, light or nonfat
For Garnish: strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and mint sprigs
1. Have an 8 to 10 cup bundt pan or ring mold ready.
2. Drain raspberries and pineapple in a sieve over a 4 cup measure, gently pressing fruit until you have 2 cups liquid.
3. Bring water to a boil in a 2 qt saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add gelatin and stir with a rubber spatula until completely dissolved.
4. Stir in reserved 2 cups fruit liquid, the drained fruit and sour cream until completely blended.  Pour into bundt pan or ring mold and refrigerate at least 8 hours until firm.
5. To unmold: Moisten serving plate with cold water (if gelatin lands off center you can slide it to the middle.)  Dip pan up to rim in warm, not hot, water about 10 seconds.  Invert moistened plate over pan.  Invert pan and plate together and shake gently from side to side to release gelatin.  Repeat process if gelatin doesn't drop from mold.  Remove pan gently.  Refrigerate salad until serving time.
6. Shortly before serving, garnish with berries and mint.
