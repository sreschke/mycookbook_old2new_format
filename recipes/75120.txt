Old Fashioned Roast Turkey

4 Tbs. butter
3 Tbs. flour
salt
rib of celery
1 onion, quartered
1 12-16 lb. turkey

baste
1/4 cup butter
2/3 cup boiling water (we use stock from giblets)

gravy
4 Tbs. fat from pan
4 Tbs. flour
2 cups juice from pan and/or stock from giblets
giblet meat, finely chopped


Place the cleaned, dry turkey on its back in the roasting pan and rub
the entire surface with salt.  Mix 4 Tbs.  of melted butter with 3
Tbs.  of flour to make a paste.  Spread over the breast and legs.
Insert celery and onion in cavity.  Place in oven at 450 until flour
starts to brown; reduce heat to 300 and baste frequently with the
remaining butter mixed with the water or stock.  After this mix is
used up, baste with pan drippings.  If you wish a crisper crust on the
bird, sprinkle flour lightly over its surface 2-3 times while
roasting.  If the legs brown too rapidly, cover with a tent of
aluminum foil, but a loose one; or a thin cloth moistened with fat.
The best temperature is 300 but never over 350.  Use a meat
thermometer or follow the cooking chart for doneness.

To make the gravy use the drippings left from cooking.  Remove the
bird from the pan and drain the pan.  Now, brown 4 Tbs.  of fat and 4
Tbs.  of flour in the pan; add 2 cups of juices from the pan and stock
made from the giblets.  Cook until thick, add giblets.
