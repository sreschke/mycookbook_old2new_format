1/4 (12oz) pkg angel hair pasta
3 or 4 cloves fresh garlic sliced like almonds
2 to 3 T extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 t  heavy cream
1/2 t  butter
Salt & pepper to taste
Flat leaf Italian parsley
Parmesan cheese

In a medium pot, put 1 to 2 quarts of water and establish a rapid boil. Add a pinch of salt but no oil.  (Oil is absorbed into the pasta, and then it doesn't absorb the sauce.)

For a single serving, place angel hair pasta in boiling water and cook for about 3 minutes or until it's al dente - or a little chewy.  While the pasta cooks, start with a cold saute pan; add cold olive oil and the garlic.  You want the garlic to heat with the oil.  Cook the garlic up until it turns golden.  If it turns brown, you've cooked it too long.  Add salt, pepper, butter and cream.  Drain the noddles and add them to the pan, stirring to coat.  Dump the noodles on a plate; top with leftover contents in the pan.  Sprinkle on Parmesan cheese and Italian parsley (not just for looks, it adds flavor).

Makes one serving.
