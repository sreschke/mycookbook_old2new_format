Makes about 6 servings.
Heat up frying pan, add some olive oil. Mix 2/3 of cheese into beaten eggs. Or, alternatively, add eggs 2 at a time to frying pan, whisk, and stir in eggs. Add salt and pepper to taste. Make into about 6 omelettes. In another skillet, saute garlic cloves until lightly browned, add tomato, basil, and salt and pepper. Cook until sauce is well reduced, stirring well. Toss in omelettes, one or two per batch of sauce, and cook two more minutes.  Dust with remaining parmesan cheese and serve hot.
