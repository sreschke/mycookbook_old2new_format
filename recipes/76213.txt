Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Slice the pound cakes into 3/4-inch thick slices. Spread on a baking sheet and toast until just golden. Remove from oven and set aside to cool slightly. Using a pastry brush, brush each piece of pound cake with melted chocolate to ?waterproof? the sandwich. Cut the pound cake slices in half on the diagonal. Slice the strawberries. Spread a thick layer of strawberry cream cheese on top of some of the slices of pound cake that have been coated with chocolate and top with sliced strawberries. Cover with a second piece of pound cake. Spread blueberry cream cheese on some of the pound cake pieces and top with macadamia nuts and a second slice of pound cake.
