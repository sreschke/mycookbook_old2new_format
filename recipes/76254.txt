               2 2/3 cups (7 ounces) flaked
               coconut
               1/2 cup sweetened
               condensed milk
               2/3 cup confectioners' sugar
               1/4 cup sliced almonds, finely chopped
               2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
               1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
               8 ounces semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped

               In a large mixing bowl, combine the coconut, milk, sugar,
               almonds, butter, and vanilla. Mix well. Cover and
               refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove from the refrigerator and
               form into balls about the size of a pecan. Line a baking
               sheet with parchment paper. In a bowl set over
               simmering water or in a double boiler, melt the
               chocolate. Using two toothpicks, dip each ball into the
               chocolate, covering them evenly. Place them on the
               prepared sheet. Using a fork, drizzle the tops of each ball
               with any remaining chocolate. Refrigerate until set. Place
               the bon bons on a serving platter and serve.
