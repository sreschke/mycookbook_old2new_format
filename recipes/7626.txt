1 box Chicken Flavored Rice A Roni
1 bunch chopped green onions
1 can black olives, sliced
1 can artichoke hearts, quartered (save liquid)
1/2 cup mayonnaise
3/4 tsp curry powder
salt and pepper to taste

Cook rice as directed on package.  Set aside and let cool.  Mix mayonnaise and curry powder together and stir into slightly cooled rice.  Add onions, olives, and artichokes stirring well to mix in vegetables.  If salad seems to thick, stir in some of the artichoke juice.  Add salt and pepper to flavor and refrigerate at least three hours before serving.  This can be prepared the day before.

I usually double or triple the recipe and don't skimp on the curry powder.

I have also served this with cooked, diced chicken breasts over lettuce as a salad luncheon.  Serve with rolls, fruit and dessert and you're set.
