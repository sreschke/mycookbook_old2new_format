                                          refrigerator overnight to thaw. Remove
                                          goose from the refrigerator, and let it
                                          stand at room temperature for 30
                                          minutes. Heat oven to 400ø Rinse goose

                                          and pat it dry with paper towels. Trim as

                                          the opening of the cavity. Remove the

                                          being careful not to cut into the flesh.

                                          goose, and pin the flap down with a
                                          wooden toothpick. Generously sprinkle
                                          the cavity with salt and pepper, and

                                          halves, garlic, thyme, and sage. Using a
                                          piece of kitchen twine, tie the legs
                                          together. Generously sprinkle the outside
                                          of the goose with salt and pepper, and
                                          place it, breast-side up on a wire rack set
                                          in a large roasting pan.

                                          a golden brown, about 1 hour. With a
                                          baster, remove as much fat as possible
                                          from the roasting pan every 30 minutes.
                                          Reduce the heat to 325ø, and roast until
                                          the goose is very well browned all over
                                          and an instant-read thermometer
                                          inserted into a breast, not touching a
                                          bone, registers 180ø, about 1 hour after
                                          reducing the temperature.

                                          which will be used when making the
                                          gravy and the dressing. Trim and discard
                                          any excess fat from the wing tips, neck,
                                          and giblets, and place them in a small
                                          stockpot. Add 4 carrot halves, 4
                                          celery-stalk halves, both onion halves,
                                          parsley, bay leaf, peppercorns, and
                                          enough water to cover the bones and
                                          vegetables by 1 inch (about 2 1/2 quarts
                                          water). Place the stockpot over high
                                          heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
                                          medium low, and simmer stock, skimming
                                          the scum as it forms, for 2 hours. Strain
                                          stock through a cheesecloth-lined
                                          strainer. Remove and discard the fat
                                          floating on the surface of the stock, and
                                          set the stockpot aside.
                                       
                                       
                                          5.  Remove goose from the oven, and
                                          transfer it to a cutting board that has a
                                          well. Let the goose stand 15 to 20
                                          minutes.
                                       
                                       
                                          6.  Meanwhile, prepare the gravy. Pour
                                          off all the fat from the roasting pan, and
                                          place the pan over high heat. Pour in
                                          wine, and cook, stirring up any brown bits
                                          with a wooden spoon until the cooking
                                          liquid is reduced by three-quarters. Add 2
                                          cups goose stock, and cook, stirring until
                                          the liquid is again reduced by
                                          three-quarters. Season with salt and
                                          pepper to taste. Stir in butter, and cook
                                          until slightly thickened. Pass the gravy
                                          through a cheesecloth-lined strainer into
                                          a gravy boat, and serve with the goose.
