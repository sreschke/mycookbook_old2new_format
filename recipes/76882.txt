2 cups varm water
1 pkg dry yeast
1/2 tsp Sugar
6 to 6 1/2 cups bread flour
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tsp salt        
1 tsp dry basil
1/2 tsp dry oregano leaves
1/4 tsp cracked pepper
2 tbs cornmeal
1 large egg white
1 tbs water
                   
In large bowl mix 1/2 cup warm water, yeast and sugar,  stir to dissolve. Let stand til bubbly, about 5 minutes.
                    
Add remaining water, 4 cups flour, cheese, oil, salt, basil, oregano and pepper to yeast mixture.  Beat 1 to 2 minutes or til smooth. Add 1 1/2 cups of the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, and beat til soft dough forms that pulls away from bowl as beaten.
                    
Turn dough out onto lightly floured board. Knead, adding as much of the remaining flour as necessary to prevent stickiness, til smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
                    
Wash, dry, and oil mixing bowl. Place dough in bowl, turning to bring oiled side up. Cover bowl  with a clean cloth and let rise until doubled, about an hour.
                     
Meanwhile, grease 2 large baking sheets. Sprinkle cornmeal in a 3 inch wide strip diagonally across each sheet. Turn dough out on lightly floured board and divide into 2 equal pieces; with hands, roll each piece into a 16 inch long loaf. Place loaves diagonally on greased sheets on top of cornmeal. Cover loaves with clean cloths and let rise in warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
                     
Heat oven to 400F. Prepare egg glaze (lightly beat egg white and water). With sharp knife, make several 1/4 inch deep slashes in top of each loaf. Gently brush egg glaze in the surface of the loaves.
                     
Bake loaves 20 minutes; remove from oven and brush again with glaze. Return to oven and bake 10  to 15 minutes longer or until loaves are golden brown. Cool loaves on wire rack at least 15 minutes before serving warm, or cool completely.
                     
To serve, cut each loaf crosswise into 8 thick slices. Store any remaining bread in an airtight container to retain freshness.
