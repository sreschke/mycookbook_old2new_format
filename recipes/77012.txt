Serves One

This recipe is nice and easy if you live alone, and looks pretty impressive to a visitor. The pineapple gives it a sweet flavour, whilst the sundried tomato adds a little kick.

Small breast of chicken
Butter Lettuce
English Spinach
Pineapple ring, diced.
4 to 6 sundried tomatoes, sliced.
Olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dressing.
Finely chopped basil, preferably fresh.

Cook the chicken breast, preferably over an open flame or BBQ. If this is not possible, in a frypan with a little garlic. Put aside. Toss some butter lettuce and English spinach leaves together, with this pineapple and sundried tomatoes. Drizzle with olive oil and vinegar, then sprinkle a small amount of basil. Chop the chicken breast into small cubes and scatter over the salad.
