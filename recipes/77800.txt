
Herbed Leg of Lamb

1 good size leg of lamb (about 4 pounds)
2 Tbs fresh lemon juice
1 Tbs dry mustard
1 tsp dried rosemary
1 tsp dried thyme
1 or 2 cloves garlic minced
1/2 tsp salt & pepper to taste

Mix all the above spices into a paste.  Brush all over 'well-trimmed'
lamb.  Roast uncovered at 350 for approximately 1 1/2 to 2 hours or
until desired doneness.  I personally like my lamb med-rare.  Do not
over cook.
