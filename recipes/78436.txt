Recipe from Cindy Sifford, Mt. Zion, Ill., as printed in Best of Country Cookies (Reiman Publications, 1999.) 

Ingredients: 

1 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 tsp. vanilla
2 cups all-purpose flour
6 squares (1 ounce each) white baking chocolate
1-1/4 cups finely chopped almonds 

Preparation: 

In a mixing bowl, beat butter and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in vanilla. Gradually add flour. Shape 1/2 cupfuls of dough into logs, 1/2-inch thick. Cut logs into 2-inch pieces. Place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 325 degrees for 15 to 17 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool. 

In a double boiler over hot, not boiling, water melt the white "chocolate." Dip one end of each cookie log into this, then cover with almonds. Place on waxed paper to set. A variation is to dip them in semi-sweet melted chocolate, then chopped almonds or pecans.
