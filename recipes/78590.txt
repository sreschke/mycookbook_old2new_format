3 Tbsp butter or margarine
1 1/2 cups thinly sliced white onions
Freshly ground black pepper (to taste)
Salt (to taste), if needed
4 1/2 cups canned beef broth
1/3 cup red wine (optional)
4 individual tureens (1-1 1/2 cup size... I just used small Corelle baking dishes)
croutons
1/2 cup coarsely shredded Swiss cheese

Melt butter in a heavy saucepan. Add onion slices that have been separated. Cover and cook 5 minutes. Uncover & cook until onions are tender and dark brown (20 to 25 minutes). Add pepper, broth and wine. Cook on low heat for 30 minutes for flavors to blend. Taste to see if salt is needed. Ladle soup into tureens & top each with croutons and Swiss cheese (approx. 2 Tbsp of cheese). Place tureens on jelly roll pan and bake in 400 F oven for 15 minutes, until cheese is melted to golden brown. Serve immediately. Serves 4.
