Ingredients for 4 Servings

1/4 jar (10-ounce) maraschino cherries
1/4 pkg (8-ounce) cream cheese, softened
1/8 cup Slivered almonds
1/8 cup Granulated sugar
1/8 tsp Almond extract
1/2 pkg (8-ounce) crescent rolls
1/8 cup Confectioner's sugar
1/2 tsp Milk
1/50 tsp Almond extract

Procedure: 

1. Drain maraschino cherries; discard juice or save for another use.  Reserve 8
to 10 maraschino cherries for garnish; chop remaining cherries.  Combine chopped
cherries, cream cheese, almonds, sugar, and almond extract; mix well.
2. Separate each can of crescent roll dough into 2 rectangles; press firmly at
edges and perforations to make one large rectangle.  Roll or pat into a
rectangle about 15x13 inches.
3. Spread cream cheese mixture over dough.  Roll up dough starting at long side
of rectangle.  Place seam-side down on greased baking sheet.  Form into a ring,
firmly pressing ends together.  With scissors or a sharp knife, cut almost
through ring at 1-inch intervals.  Turn each section slightly on its side.
4. Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. 
If necessary, cover with foil during last 5 minutes to prevent over browning. 
Carefully remove from pan to wire rack.
5. Combine confectioner' sugar, milk and almond extract to make a glaze. 
Drizzle over coffee cake.  Garnish with reserved whole cherries.
6. Refrigerate leftovers.
