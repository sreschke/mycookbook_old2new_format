Gerardo's Easy Chicken Mole

Broth:
2-3 pounds chicken cut up (I use legs with back attached and cut apart the legs and backs)
1 onion cut up coarsely
3-4 garlic cloves
fresh herbs such as parsley, thyme,etc.

Put all ingredients in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and simmer until chicken is done (about15-25 minutes). 

Strain broth and set aside chicken and broth for the next step 

Mole:
1 jar of mole such as Ibarra
3 jars (use the jar which the mole came in to measure) of chicken broth (see above)
3 tablespoons raisions
3 tablespoons of pecans or peanuts or a mix
1 slice of bread (toasted)
1/4 of a chocolate tablet (use a brand such as Ibarra which comes in hexagonal tablets!)
toasted sesame seeds as needed


Blend well all ingredients except toasted sesame seeds in a food processor or blender. Transfer to a large pan on medium heat (careful as the chocolate could burn if you heat it too quickly) and constantly stir to blend all the flavours until it is heated. If the mole is too thick, you can always dilute it with additional chicken broth. This makes enough mole for 2 batches (4-6 pounds of chicken) so I usually freeze half of the mole. Add the chicken and keep stirring until the chicken is warm. Serve immediately with toasted sesame seeds sprinkled on top.
