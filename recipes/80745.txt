" This is a recipe that a real Navajo Indian lady taught me "

FRY BREAD :
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 Tb baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
Very warm water (1 cup +)
3" Hot oil or lard in 10" skillet 

NOTE:These are made like a tostada shape..

Mix flour, baking powder and salt in large bowl. Make a well in flour and slowly pour and knead together water and flour with clean hands until soft ball of dough forms.Adding flour or more water ok. Cover bowl with towel or frying pan lid and let rise for about 20 min. After dough has risen slightly, separate dough into balls . Keep covered to keep moisture in. Heat oil in skillet to fairly hot temp. so tacos will cook rapidly. With clean floured hands, begin to squish and pat ball in your hands with a back and forth motion like making tortillas. Pull into a roundish shape at  the corners until it is about as big as a corn tortilla.Does not have to look perfect.Try not to play with it to long as it tends to make it tough.If it has some holes thats ok, but not to many. Carefully put into hot oil and fry for a few seconds and turn when light golden brown color. Use tongs.  Set on to several paper towels to drain.Makes about  6 tacos.
