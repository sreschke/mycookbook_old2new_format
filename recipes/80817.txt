Leek, tarragon and mushroom risotto
For 2
3 small tender leeks 
50g butter 
225g assorted small mushrooms, wild or cultivated, wiped 
2 tbsps chopped tarragon 
275g arborio rice 
1 litre hot chicken or vegetable stock 
a large knob of butter 
2 tbsps coarsely chopped parsley 


This risotto can be made with any funghi - even little white button mushrooms are good cooked in this way. Cut the leeks, discarding the very dark green bits, into small rings about 1cm thick. Wash them thoroughly in a colander under running water to remove any grit or sand. Cook them in the butter over a moderate heat for about 7-8 minutes, until they soften and become translucent. They should not colour.

Cut the mushrooms into bite-sized pieces. Add them to the leeks and stir to coat them in butter. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the tarragon and the rice. Stir to coat the rice with the butter and then pour on a ladleful of hot stock. Cook until the rice has absorbed the stock and then add more hot stock, stirring from time to time. If you run out of stock and the rice is still not tender, carry on with water. When the rice has taken up all the stock stir in butter, season with salt and parsley.

Spicy fridge rice

For 2 
1 plump clove of garlic, chopped 
small knob of fresh root ginger, peeled and shredded 
2 tbsps groundnut oil 
1 tsp hot chilli powder 
1 tsp mustard seeds 
Â¬ tsp ground turmeric 
1 tsp hot chilli powder 
225g cooked long-grain rice

Some intelligence called for here. If you have some cooked rice in the fridge you may well have other good things in there too. What follows is a basic spicy rice that will act as a base to which you can add leftovers to produce a quick, not to say frugal supper. Leftovers is a difficult word, rather like offal. But the alternatives are even worse, as in 'variety meats'. Whatever you call them they must be in good condition; crisp cooked greens, diced chicken or perhaps a casserole or curry.

Fry the garlic and ginger in the oil in a wok or frying-pan. Add the mustard seeds, and when they start to pop add the turmeric, chilli and rice. Stir. Cook for 2 minutes or until the rice is hot, then stir in any of the following: diced cooked chicken, stir-fried for 2 minutes in a little oil; cooked greens (spinach is best), chopped roughly, added with the spices and before the rice; mushrooms, again added before the rice and cooked for 2 minutes; leftover ratatouille, or meat or chicken casserole, or even curry - warm it slowly, and then bring to the boil; as it starts to boil stir in the spiced rice, and eat hot. Sunday's roast torn into bite-sized pieces - stir-fry till hot and then add any gravy or pan juices.
