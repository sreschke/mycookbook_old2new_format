Grammie Beas Baked Beans

3 c. dry beans
1 lg. onion or 2-3 small
1/2 lb. salt pork
little under 1/2 c. sugar
2 T. brown sugar
2 T. molasses
2 tsp. dry mustard
1/2 tsp. pepper
1 tsp. salt if salt pork has meat in it OR 1 T. salt if salt pork is all fat

Put cleaned beans in pot. Set aside

Mix sugars, molasses and mustard. Add salt and pepper. Mix into beans. Add enough water to cover beans. Place salt pork down into beans. You can opt to cut it up or leave it whole like my gram used to do. You can also put the onions in whole, or opt to chop them up. She used to keep them whole, so us kids could fight over them lol. 

Bake in bean pot at 200 all night or 8 hrs. If not done, finish in the morning. When beans are ready to be eaten, turn oven up to 450 until beans start to boil, then turn back to 200 until ready to serve.

If beans look like they are drying out just add water as you are cooking.
