  Prepare rice according to directions or your desire.
   Set aside. Cut up the chicken into small chunks and cook through,
either
  on the stove top or the microwave.  You can either cook it and then cut
it
  up, or cut it up and then cook it. Chop onion and peppers into small
  pieces.  Saute onion and pepper in the butter for about 4 minutes or
until
  tender. Cut up the ham slice into small cube-like pieces.
   (Although, any kind of ham, sliced, diced, cubed, would do). Stir in
the
  cooked chicken, cubed ham, soup (straight from the can), and the milk.
Heat
  until chicken is hot, stirring frequently. Stir the rice into the
mixture
  and cook another few minutes until everything is hot. Be sure to mix in
  rice thoroughly. Will keep well if you prepare ahead and reheat before
  serving.  Just be sure to heat it and mix it again well before serving.
  Freezes well also if you want to make an extra batch.
