1 cup sour cream 
1 cup cottage cheese
1 cup cheddar cheese
1 Tbs minced onion 
salt and pepper to taste
2 Tbs butter, melted
6 eggs

Preheat oven to 350Ã¸F. In a bowl combine potatoes, sour cream, cottage cheese, cheddar cheese, onion, salt and pepper. Mix well and into a greased 9"x13" casserole. Pour melted butter on top and make 6 indentations in the top. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until puffed slightly and just starting to turn golden. Remove  casserole and crack 1 egg into each indentation. Return to oven and continue baking for an additional 15 to 20 minutes or until eggs have reached desired state of readiness (for runny yolks, only cook eggs 12 to 15 minutes). Remove from oven when eggs are done and let set for about 2 minutes before serving. You can top with additional cheddar cheese when you add eggs. This can be made ahead of time to the point where eggs are added. To reheat, just add eggs and cook until they are done. Serves 6.
