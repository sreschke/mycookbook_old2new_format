Meringue with Strawberries and Cream

Once you remove the meringue from the oven, just let it sit on the counter, uncovered, until it is ready to be filled and served (the same day). Be careful removing the meringue from the springform pan, as it is very fragile. Don't worry though if pieces do break off - the imperfections just add to the character of the dessert. Store leftovers in the refrigerator.
ÿ
6 egg whites
2 cups granulated sugar
1 tsp white vinegar
1 tsp vanilla
2 cups heavy cream
1-2 pints diced strawberries
ÿ
Preheat oven to 300øF. Grease and dust with matzah meal a 9" or 10" springform pan. Whip egg whites until stiff, up to 15 minutes (or about 5 minutes in a Kitchen Aid mixer). Gradually add sugar and whip a few more minutes. Add vinegar and vanilla and whip until it looks like marshmallow. Spoon egg white mixture into pan and make sides a little higher than middle. Bake for 50 minutes, shut off oven, and leave pan in oven overnight. 
When ready to serve, whip cream until soft peaks form and fold in diced strawberries. Gently break off top crust of meringue and set pieces aside. Remove rest of meringue from pan by running a knife several times around sides and then releasing pan. (You can gently move meringue to a platter by running a knife underneath it and transferring it with a spatula, or just place meringue still attached to bottom of springform pan directly on platter.) Spoon cream and strawberries on top of meringue base and place reserved crust pieces back on top. Use a serrated-edged knife to carefully cut meringue into serving pieces.
