Preheat oven to 375øF. Place squash, cut side down, in a shallow baking pan. Add enough water to cover about 1" of squash halves. Use a pastry brush or cloth to lightly coat exposed squash skin with olive oil. Bake squash for about 20 minutes, or until about half cooked. The squash still should be fairly tough. Meanwhile, combine 1 tablespoon of olive oil, matzo, onion, celery and garlic in a medium saucepan and saute for about 6 minutes, or until very soft. The mixture will stick to the pan, so stir frequently. Add stock, apricots and nuts and allow to cook for 12 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in parsley and pepper. Remove squash from oven, turn upright and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Fill each squash with stuffing and arrange on a baking sheet. Use remaining olive oil to lightly coat any exposed squash meat. Bake for 50 minutes, or until squash is soft and easily pierced by a fork.
