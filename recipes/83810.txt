METHOD:  Slice venison loin into medallions, rub meat with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Heat pan and add meat, searing both sides, (turning only once).  Keep meat rare, remove and spread out on a plate so the heat dissipates.  Add peppercorns, mushrooms and garlic to pan, saute.  Deglaze (removing the brown from the bottom of the pan by adding liquid) the pan with wine.  Add sugar, let wine reduce by half.  Add brown sauce, bring to boil and reduce by half again.  Adjust taste, add reserved meat to the sauce.  Serve immediately.  This goes well with steamed green beans, creamed corn and horseradish mashed potatoes.  Serves 6.
