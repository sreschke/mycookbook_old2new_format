1/2 cup (1 stick) Butter or Margarine, softened
1 cup Sugar
1 Egg
1 tsp. Vanilla Extract
1 cup plus 3 Tbs. All-Purpose Flour, divided
1/2 tsp. Baking Soda
1/4 cup Hershey's Cocoa
1/2 cup Reese's Peanut Butter Chips, melted

1.  Beat butter, sugar, egg and vanilla in large bowl until fluffy.  Add 1 cup flour and baking soda; beat until blended.  Remove 3/4 cup batter to small bowl; set aside.  Add cocoa and remaining 3 Tbs. flour to remaining batter in large bowl; blend well.

2.  Place peanut butter chips in small microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave at high (100 %) 30 seconds or until melted and smooth when stirred.  Immediately add to batter in small bowl, stirring until smooth.  Divide chocolate dough into four equal parts.  Roll each part between plastic wrap or wax paper into a log 7 inches long and about 1 inch in diameter.  Repeat with peanut butter dough.  Wrap the eight rolls individually in wax paper or plastic wrap.  Refrigerate several hours until very firm.

3.  Heat oven to 350'.  Remove rolls from wax paper.  Place 1 chocolate roll and 1 peanut butter roll side by side on a cutting board.  Top each roll with another roll of the opposite flavor to make checkerboard pattern.  Lightly push rolls together; repeat with remaining four rolls.  Working with one checkerboard at a time (keep remaining checkerboard covered and refrigerated), cut into 1/4-inch slices.  Place on ungreased cookie sheet.

4.  Bake 8 to 9 minutes or until peanut butter portion is lightly browned.  Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheet to wire rack.  Cool completely.
