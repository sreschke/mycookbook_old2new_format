2 CAKES YEAST             1 TBS SUGAR
1 C WARM WATER

Dissolve yeast in warm water, add in sugar and mix well.

Cool to lukewarm, and add to yeast mixture.

Beat 3 EGGS well and add to mixture.
Slowly mix in enough flour to make soft dough.  Cover with warm damp cloth and let rise in warm place.  
Put on floured cloth (I divide dough in half-too much at one time) and roll out a spread generously with melted butter, sugar and cinnomon.  Roll up and slice.
Place in sprayed muffin tin or leave as tea ring.
Let rise.
Bake at 350 for 15-20 mins or until golden.

This recipe belonged to Grandma Gladys.  She was quite well known in the our community for her cinnamon rolls.  You could always find them at the Church Bazaar of a local Women's Club bake sale.  
She always had these on hand for us, when we were growing up.  
I still have people ask me for her the recipe....
