Curry of Beef Zanzibar
Yield: 8 servings
What a lovely curry dish this is! It is quite yellow in color, and the sauce is smooth and velvety. It is the combination of all the spices which makes this great dish. Use a good quality of curry and make it with any meat. It is frequently served with beef liver in East Africa. Try it with lamb or veal as a change.
