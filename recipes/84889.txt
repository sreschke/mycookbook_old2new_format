Spice mix for one chicken
4 tsp. salt
2 tsp. paprika
1 tsp. cayenne pepper (I use less)
1 tsp. onion powder
1 tsp. thyme
1 tsp. white pepper
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. black pepper
1 large roasting chicken -- as big as you can find
1 cup chopped onion

In a small bowl, thoroughly combine all of the spices. Remove giblets from chicken, clean the cavity well and pat dry with paper towels. Rub the spice mixture into the chicken, inside and out, making sure it is evenly distributed and down deep into the skin. Place in a resealable plastic bag, seal and refridgerate overnight.

When ready to roast chicken, stuff cavity with onions, and place in a shallow baking pan. Roast, uncovered, at 250 degrees for 5 hours (yes, 250 degrees for 5 hours). After the first hour, baste chicken occasionally (every half hour or so) with pan juices. The pan juices will start to carmelize on the bottom of pan and the chicken will turn golden brown. If the chicken contains a pop-up thermometer, ignore it. Let chicken rest about 10 minutes before carving.
