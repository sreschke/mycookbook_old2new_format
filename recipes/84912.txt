Indian Beef

2 lbs.of a tender cut of beef, cut into cubes
3 teaspoons of unflavored yogurt
1 1/2 teaspoons of salt
1 teaspoon of ground coriander
1 teaspoon of ground cumin
1 clove
2 teaspoons of paprika
1 teaspoon of allspice
1/4 teaspoon of ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon of minced garlic
1 1/2 cup of finely chopped onion
2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
2 medium tomatoes, chopped

Heat the oil in a non-stick pan and add the onion.  Cook until the
onion is light brown.  Add the garlic.  After one minute, add the
tomatoes and spices.  Stir until it is just like a paste.  If needed
add a half cup of water.  Add the yogurt and meat and stir well to
coat the meat with the paste.  Cover and cook on low heat for 45 to 50
minutes.  Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

Note: After the meat is added, after a few minutes there will be a lot
of water.  However this water will evaporate as the meat continues to
cook.  After 30 to 35 minutes the water will be evaporated.  Then just
continue to cook and stir.  Serve with Basmati rice.
