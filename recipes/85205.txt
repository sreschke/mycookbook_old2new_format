Cook pasta according to package directions; drain. Meanwhile, in a large skillet cook the garlic in hot oil over med. high heat for 30 seconds. Add chicken, basil and crushed red pepper. Cook and stir for 4 min. Add chicken broth, dried tomatoes and white wine. Bring to boiling;  reduce heat. Simmer uncovered for about 10 min or til chicken is tender and no longer pink. Stir in whipping cream and the 2/4 cup Parmesan cheese; simmer 2 minutes more. Stir pasta into chicken mixture. Heat through. Pass additional Parmesan cheese, if desired. Makes 4 main dish servings.

I added the extra pasta to make the dish a bit less heavy (that cream!)
