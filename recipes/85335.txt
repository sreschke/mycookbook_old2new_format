1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
1/4 cup oil
1-1/2 cups sugar
3 eggs
2 Tbs rum or orange liqueur
2 tsp vanilla
1/4 to 1/2 tsp lime oil
1/4 tsp lemon oil
3/4 tsp tangerine or orange oil 
zest of 1 large orange, finely minced zest of 3 limes, finely minced 
1 toasted coconut
1/2 cup macadamia nuts, chopped 
1 cup cubed pineapple (14 oz can), diced
1 cup chopped dried apricot 
1/3 cup dried mango, diced
1/3 cup golden raisins
3-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tsp baking powder
3/8 tsp salt 
shredded coconut for garnish 

Topping:
1 cup rum or orange liqueur
1 cup sugar 

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper (insert each into a second sheet if you have enough to go around). 
Preheat oven to 350øF. In a large mixing bowl, blend melted butter, oil, sugar and eggs. Stir in citrus oils and vanilla. Mix well. Fold in dried fruit and then flour, baking powder and salt to make a thick batter. Let batter stand for 10 minutes. Spread batter out into 2 logs on baking sheets. It will be sticky. Top with shredded coconut, pressing in slightly. Place baking sheets in oven and bake until tops of logs seem set and dry (45 to 55 minutes). If logs are browning too quickly, reduce heat to 325øF and lengthen baking time. Allow logs to cool for 20 minutes before moving them to a cutting board. Slice logs in long diagonal slices and return to baking sheets. REduce oven temperature to 325øF. Bake cookies, turning once, for 15 to 20 minutes. Allow cookies to dry and barely brown. Using topping: Prepare cookies as above. Before second bake, place rum in a shallow dish and sugar on a baking sheet. Brush one side of each cookie liberally with rum, and then press lightly into sugar (parchment paper comes in very handy with this variation).
