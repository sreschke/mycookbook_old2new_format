A waiter at Lone Star told us that the Texas Ranch dressing is just ranch dressing with chili powder and cayenne pepper added. They make it themselves. So we make it at home using an envelope of Hidden Valley ranch dressing. Make according to package directions. Add the chili powder and pepper, a little at a time, until it's to your taste. My husband makes it perfectly. Servings: 4
