2 cups sliced peaches

1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup butter
1/2 tsp salt
1 Tbs baking powder
1/2 tsp vanilla
1 cup flour

Preheat oven to 325øF. Place sliced peaches in bottom of an 8"x8"x2" pan 
(you can used frozen or canned peaches in a pinch, be sure to drain well ). 
Batter: Combine sugar and butter, all dry ingredients, alternately with milk. Pour over peaches. 
Topping: Mix sugar and cornstarch with salt. Sift over batter. Pour boiling water over all. Bake for 50 minutes. Serve warm (or as hot as you can stand), with or without ice cream or cream. The batter rises to make a nice topping, and the sugar makes it pretty. The rest of the sugar and the cornstarch and water go to the bottom and make a lovely sauce.
