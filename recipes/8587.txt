  This easy breakfast is sooo good, the week we discovered it, we made it 3 more times. It also makes a great instant dessert (kind of like bread pudding). The recipe works great with your regular presliced bread, but you can also get fancy and use walnut bread. Be careful not to soak the bread too long or it can make frying and fliping a hassle. Generally, smaller bread pieces make for easier flipping. Good variations include the toast stuffed with mascarpone cheese and different jellies and jam.
