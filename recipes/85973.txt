Here is a recipe off the back of Ore-Ida Country Style Hash Browns. I have fixed before and is very good.

3 cups frozen Ore-Ida Country Style Hash Browns**
1 10 3/4-ounce can cream of celery soup*
1 cup dairy sour cream
1 cup cubed ham
1 cup croutons (any flavor)


1. Preheat oven to 400 F.
2. In medium bowl, combine undiluted soup and sour cream; blend well.
3. Stir in frozen Hash Browns and ham.
4. Spoon into ungreased 1 1/2-quart casserole.
5. Cover and bake for 40-50 minutes or until bubbly and potatoes are tender, stirring once after 20 minutes.
6. Remove from oven and sprinkle with croutons.

Serves 4

*May also be orepared with frozen Ore-Ida Potatoes O'Brien or Southern Style Hash Browns.

** I don't use cream of celery soup, instead I use cream of mushroom. But guess you could use whatever type you want.
