Notes:
Well I finally figured out how to get that taste. Let the sauce simmer as long as you can!


Ingredients:
1 pint of Heavy Cream 
1 stick of butter 
2 Tbsp. Cream Cheese 
1/2 - 3/4 C. Parmesan cheese 
1 tsp. Garlic powder 


Preparation:
In a saucepan combine butter, heavy cream, and cream cheese. Simmer this until all is melted, and mixed well. Add the Parmesan cheese and Garlic powder. Simmer this for 15 - 20 minutes on low. You may wish to season with a little salt and pepper. I have done this with half and half, but we prefer the heavy cream. But I wouldn't try it with plain milk.
