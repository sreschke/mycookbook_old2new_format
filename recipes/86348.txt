1 lb ground beef 
1 10oz can condensed tomato soup 
1 cup water 
1 cup salsa 
1 cup cheese 
6 8" flour tortillas 
taco seasoning 
 
Brown beef in TC. Season it with salt, pepper and taco seasoning. Cut tortillas into one inch pieces.  When beef is browned, drain fat. Add soup, water, salsa, half of cheese and tortilla pieces. (I threw some frozen broccoli on the steamer rack at this point.) Cook on med to med-high, valve closed for 10 minutes. Stir, add remaining cheese, cook valve open another 2 minutes to thicken. 
Serves 4-6.
