Decadent Chocolate Cupcakes With Molten Center 

1-1/2 sticks unsalted butter 
5 oz bittersweet chocolate, broken into pieces 
3 large eggs 
3 large egg yolks
1/4 cup sugar
3 Tbs all-purpose flour 
lightly sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream 

Preheat oven to 350øF. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan or a microwave-proof dish and evenly brush inside six 8-ounce custard cups, ramekins, or cappuccino cups. In the top of a double boiler or in a medium heat-proof bowl set over barely simmering water, melt chocolate and remaining butter together. Remove from heat. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, or in a large mixing bowl using a handheld electric mixer, beat together eggs, egg yolks, and sugar at medium speed until mixture is pale yellow, thick, and creamy, about 5 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold about 1/3 of egg mixture at a time into melted chocolate-butter mixture. When they are fully incorporated, evenly sprinkle and gently fold in flour until no streaks remain. Pour batter into prepared cups or ramekins, filling them about 2/3 full. Place cups or ramekins on a baking sheet and bake until sides of cupcakes look firm but centers are still moist when a wooden toothpick is inserted into center of one, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove cupcakes from the oven and set them aside to cool for about 10 minutes before serving, either in their cups or ramekins or unmolded onto serving plates. Serve with lightly sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
