Strawberry Topping 
(that's wonderful on New York-style cheesecake as well as ice cream): 
2 lbs hulled strawberries
1/2 cup sugar
pinch salt
1 cup strawberry jam
2 Tbs fresh lemon juice 
Toss strawberries that have been cut into 1/4"to 3/8" wedges with sugar and salt. Allow berries to rest at room temperature about 30 minutes or until they have released some juices, gently tossing occasionally. Process strawberry jam in food processor fitted with metal blade until smooth. Place in saucepan and simmer on medium heat until dark and no longer frothy, about 3 minutes. Stir lemon juice. Pour over strawberries and stir. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 12 hours. Makes about 1-1/2 quarts
