1 1/2 tablespoons fresh garlic - minced
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups chicken stock preferably home made
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
3/4 cup Parmesan cheese ? grated (I used out of a jar, but I think calls for fresh)

1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice

3/4 cup sour cream
10 (one box) ounces frozen chopped spinach ? defrosted

In a large saucepan, warm the olive oil and butter over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add onion and cook until wilted (4 minutes). Add the garlic and cook 2 minutes longer, stirring occasionally.Sprinkle the flour over the onion mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture turns golden brown in color (12 minutes). While whisking, slowly pour chicken broth into onion-flour mixture until it is smoothly incorporated. When the mixture begins to simmer, stir in the cream. Allow mixture to simmer and remove from the heat. Add the Parmesan, bouillon, lemon juice, and sugar. Stir until thoroughly blended.Add the sour cream, spinach, artichoke hearts, Monterey Jack cheese and tabasco sauce. Stir until the ingredients are thoroughly combined and the cheese has melted. Transfer to a warm serving bowl and serve immediately with chips or bread cubes.
