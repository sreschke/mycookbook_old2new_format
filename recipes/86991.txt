Hello all of my Fellow Foodies! 

This is my favorite ezine ever!  Thanks Chef!  My name is Veronica. 
My husband of nine years and I live in Alvaton, KY.  I am a long time 
subscriber - first time contributor.  This recipe is the most 
requested that I am asked to bring to any gathering where food is 
involved- and the best thing is that it is so easy!  Will be glad to 
tell any one who emails me what specific cereal that I use in this 
recipe.  Since this ezine reaches far and wide, I am asking for a 
little help/guidance in planning my 10 year Anniversary - we are 
wanting to take a two week trip out West and I would like to hear from 
anyone who can tell me where to stay, what to see, etc.  We would like 
to fly out to Yellowstone Park, rent a car and then see the sites from 
there down to Vegas, where we would like to spend a couple of days 
before returning home.  Can anyone help me on this?  Thanks! 

Peanut Chewies 

1 Stick of butter or margarine 
3/4 cup Sugar 
3/4 cup light corn syrup  (the color is light - not "lite") 
3/4 cup Peanut Butter 
1 teaspoon Vanilla 
3/4 cup Peanuts  ( this is optional - I don't use the peanuts) 
6 cups of firm flake cereal 

In a large sauce pan, melt butter/margarine and add sugar and corn 
syrup.  Bring to a boil and boil for 1 1/2 minutes (90 seconds - do 
not over boil, makes bars really hard!).  Remove from heat and stir in 
peanut butter and vanilla till blended and then add peanuts and 
cereal.  Spread in a 9 x 13 pan and cool.  Cut into bars.  Will need 
to keep them in an airtight container.
