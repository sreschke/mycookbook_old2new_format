Dampfkraut - Stewed Cabbage   
  
2 cups shredded cabbage 
2 cups sauerkraut with juice 
1/2 cup water 
3 Tablespoons butter 
3 Tablespoons flour 
1/4 Tablespoon brown sugar 

Put the fresh cabbage into a pot. Add water and cover and bring it to a boil and cook on low heat for 30 to 40 minutes until the cabbage is soft. Add the sauerkraut and the brown sugar. Can add a bit more water if necessary (1/4 inch of juice on the bottom is just about right). Simmer the mixture for another 10 minutes to blend. Meanwhile, prepare brown sauce by melting the butter in a pan. Add in the flour and cook over medium heat, while stirring until the sauce is a rich brown. Strain the sauce into the cabbage sauerkraut mixture and then stir to mix. Serve as a vegetable dish. Serves 4 people. For an all-sweet kraut dish, use fresh cabbage only (Use 4 cups of cabbage).
