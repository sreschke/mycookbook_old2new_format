1 large turnip 
1 small bunch of thin asparagus 
1 medium red onion 
1 medium red bell pepper 
1 tablespoon olive oil 
balsamic vinegar 
salt and fresh ground pepper to taste

Slice all the vegetables into equal sized slices, about 2-3 inches long. Use only as much of the onion as can be cut to this size; it will only be about half of the onion.

After removing the chicken from the oven, increase the heat to 550 degrees. Spread the seasoned vegetables out on a sheet tray.
