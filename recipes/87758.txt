Makes 20 tamales
 

3 cups pre-cooked corn flour (MASECA for tamales or P.A.N. work well)
3/4 teaspoon salt
4-1/2 cups lukewarm water

Stuffing:
1 Tablespoon oil (I prefer olive)
4 garlic cloves, minced
3 medium onions, minced
4 ripe tomatoes, peeled and minced
1-1/2 cups cooked garbanzo beans (chickpeas)
1/4 cup capers
2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
20 plantain leaves or foil paper (10" x 10")
Twine

Mix the corn flour and salt, slowly add water while mixing until a smooth dough that is just slightly sticky is obtained. Set the dough aside for 10 minutes.

Sautâ€š the garlic and onions in oil until the onions are translucent. Add the tomatoes, garbanzo beans, capers, and seasonings; mix well and cook over low fire for 5 minutes. 

To assemble the tamales, wet the center of one side of the banana leaf with some of the juice from the sauce, then take some of the dough and smooth it with your hands over the center of the leaf to form a 4" square that is about 1/2" thick. In the center of this square spoon some of the sauce, leaving about 1" border all around. Then take some more dough and pat it over the square making sure that all the stuffing is covered, and press all four sides down to seal the contents in. Fold the sides of the banana leaf over the dough so that it looks like a small packet and tie with twine. Pour 1" water in a large pot and place a steaming rack over it. (Metal ones are cheap, fit most pans and can be found in any store that sells cooking utensils.) Neatly stack the tamales, cover the pot with a lid, and steam for one hour. The level of the water should be checked on a regular basis; if it is too low, then add some more. Tamales can be prepared a day or so in advance and reheated over a steam bath before serving. Do not eat banana leaves.
