
> My family is quickly tiring of salads and green beans. I make 
cauliflower fauxtatoes occasionally and we like broccoli, but what 
else is there that's easy and good?

I make faux potato salad. Steam and drain the cauliflower. Cool, chop 
coarsely and use in your favorite potato salad recipe. Coleslaw is 
good. too. By the pre-shredded bags or shred your own and use almost 
any creamy recipe - just skip the sugar (or sub with AS). Try 
broccoli slaw for a change or pace.

For cooked veggies, cabbage "pasta" is easy. Shred cabbage, cook for 
2-3 minutes in boiling water with a little cram or caraway added and 
serve like noodles. The short cooking time and cream or caraway 
prevents the unpleasant odor many folks associate with cabbage. 

Spaghetti squash is another fun one. Halve the squash, remove the 
seeds and bake or micrwave until tender. Taks a fork and pull out 
the "spaghetti" strands of squash. 

Stir fry is also pretty easy, after you chop everything up. Use any 
combination of "legal" veggies - my favorites are various colors of 
bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, bean 
sprouts and bamboo shoots. Cook in a very hot pan with a little 
sesame or canola oil, stirring constantly until veggies are slightly 
wilted and crisp-tender. Toss in some sliced tofu or meat and dinner 
is served.
