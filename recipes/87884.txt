Mix all ingredients together and pour over meat or veggies in a ziploc bag. Marinate at least one hour for best flavor.

One of my favorites is to use this marinade on a pork tenderloin. Let it marinate, slice on the diagonal into medallions, and grill. When almost done, baste with your favorite barbecue sauce. Yummy!!
