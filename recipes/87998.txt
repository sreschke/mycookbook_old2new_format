Ingredients     
      2/3 cup coarsely chopped onion 
2/3 cup coarsely chopped celery 
2/3 cup coarsely chopped carrot 
1/4 cup raisins 
1/4 cup water 
1 teaspoon instant chicken bouillon granules 
1/8 teaspoon pepper 
1 cup coarsely chopped cooking apple, unpeeled, such as Jonathan or Rome Beauty 
2 (1 1/2 pound) Cornish game hens, halved lengthwise 
1/4 cup toasted almonds 
   
 APPLE BRANDY SAUCE: 
1 cup apple juice 
4 teaspoons cornstarch 
1 tablespoon brown sugar 
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
4 teaspoons brandy 
 

 Directions     
1 Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. For stuffing, in a medium saucepan combine onion, celery, carrot, raisins, water, bouillon granules, and pepper. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain. Stir in the apple. 
2 Spoon stuffing into 4 mounds on the bottom of a greased 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Place hen halves, cut side down, over the vegetable mounds. Bake, loosely covered, for 1 hour. 
3 Uncover hens; brush with some of the Apple-Brandy Sauce. Bake, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes more or until hens are tender and an instant-read thermometer registers 180 degrees F, brushing once or twice with more sauce. 
4 Using a wide spatula, transfer hens with stuffing to dinner plates. Sprinkle with almonds. Heat remaining sauce until bubbly and pass at the table. Makes 4 main-dish servings. 
5 Apple-Brandy Sauce: In a small saucepan combine 1 cup apple juice, 4 tsp. cornstarch, 1 Tbsp. brown sugar, and 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat. Stir in 4 tsp. brandy, if desired. Set aside. 
  Make-Ahead Tip: Sauce can be made the day before without the brandy. Cover; chill. Stir in brandy, if desired, before using sauce.
