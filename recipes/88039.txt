
2 lemons cut in half
16 baby artichokes or frozen artichoke hearts
3/4 cup olive oil
salt and freshly ground pepper
4 whole chicken breasts, split, skinned, boned and cut into 2-inch chunks
2 red onions, sliced 1/4" thick
1/2 cup chicken stock
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup Nicoise olives
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Use 1/2 the lemon to rub the cut portion of the artichoke.  Fill a large bowl with water and squeeze into it the juice from the other lemon half.  Cut each artichoke in half, immerse artichokes immediately into the lemon
water to prevent darkening. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat.  Dry the artichoke pieces and add to the pan.  Reduce the
heat and sprinkle with a tablespoon or two of lemon juice. Cook, partially covered and stirring occasionally, until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a very large saute pan over high heat.  Add the chicken pieces and brown
lightly on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the pan.  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same pan over medium heat.  Add the
onions and cook 5 to 7 minutes until the onions are translucent.  Return the chicken and artichokes to the pan and add the broth, minced garlic and
remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice.  Cook until the liquid is syrupy.  Season to taste.  Sprinkle with olives and parsley. Serves 8
