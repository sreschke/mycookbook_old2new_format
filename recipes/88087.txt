Pecan Pie 

3 eggs
2/3 cup sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1/3 cup melted butter
1 cup light corn syrup 
1 cup pecan halves  
1 9" pie crust, baked 

Beat eggs, sugar, salt, butter, and syrup with rotary beater. Stir in nuts. Pour all in crust. Bake 40-50 minutes at 375Ã¸F. 
(Note: It may need to cook longer, bake until the center doesn't "jiggle". It is not a bad idea to cover the pie with aluminum foil to keep the crust from burning--many times it will brown nicely even with the foil; if not, remove the foil for the last 5-10 minutes.)
