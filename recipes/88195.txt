Recipe: Baked Bluefish
Time: About 30 minutes plus one hour for salting tomatoes

2 medium ripe tomatoes 
Salt 
4 bulb onions or 8 scallions 
2 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 
1 clove garlic, sliced thin 
2 cups fresh bread crumbs 
 1/2 cup loosely packed basil leaves 
 1/2 cup loosely packed flat parsley leaves 
1 cup clam juice 
 1/4 cup dry white wine 
1 3-pound bluefish, filleted and cut in 4 portions, or 4 bluefish fillets, with skin, each about 6 ounces 
Freshly ground black pepper. 

1. Core tomatoes and slice  1/4-inch thick. Place on rack over baking sheet and salt generously on both sides. Set aside 1 hour.

2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. If using bulb onions, trim roots and leave about 4 inches of stem. Cut each in half lengthwise. If using scallions, trim roots and leave whole. Brush onions or scallions with  1/2 tablespoon oil. Place on baking sheet and roast until tender, about 20 minutes. Set aside.

3. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in small skillet, add garlic, sautâ€š over low heat until barely golden, remove pan from heat and set aside.

4. Place crumbs, basil and parsley in food processor or blender and process until blended. In pan, bring clam juice and wine to a simmer and remove from heat. Increase oven heat to 500 degrees.

5. Using remaining oil, lightly oil baking dish that will hold bluefish in a single layer. Place bluefish fillets in dish skin side up. Place onions or scallions around fish. Place 2 to 3 slices tomato, slightly overlapping, on each fillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cover fish, tomatoes and onions generously with bread crumbs. Pour clam stock around fish and drizzle with garlic oil, with or without slices of garlic, on top. Bake 12 to 15 minutes, until just cooked through and lightly browned. Serve at once.
