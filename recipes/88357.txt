Have the butcher cut through the chine bone to make carving easy.  Cook the meat with a meat thermometer inserted vertically into the center of the roast until the temperature reaches 160 degrees.

3-1/4 pounds boned rib end loin pork roast
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme or 1-1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup apple cider or juice

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl mix together the mustard, half the thyme, and the oil. Rub this paste all over the outside of the meat and
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the roast, bone side down, in a shallow roasting pan and place in oven. Immediately reduce oven temperature
to 325 degrees and roast for 20 to 25 minutes per pound, or until a meat thermometer registers 155 degrees. Remove the roast to a platter and cover
with foil. Pour off all fat from roasting pan. Place roasting pan over medium heat and add the apple cider or juice.  Using a wooden spoon, stir
to dissolve all the brown bits that have adhered to the pan. Simmer for two minutes.  Stir in the remaining thyme and season with salt and pepper to
taste.  Carve the meat, cutting down between the bones. Stir any accumulated juices into the sauce. Serve the meat with some gravy spooned
over the top. Serves 6.
