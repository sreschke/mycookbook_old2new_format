Gazpacho 
(Adapted from Lespinasse) 

For the gazpacho: 
4 large tomatoes, coarsely chopped 
2 1/2 seedless cucumbers, peeled and coarsely chopped 
1 1/2 medium red onions, peeled and coarsely chopped 
1 medium red pepper, seeded and coarsely chopped 
1 medium green pepper, seeded and coarsely chopped 
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and coarsely chopped 
1 tablespoon cumin 
1 tablespoon coarse salt, plus additional to taste 
1 teaspoon cayenne 
3 tablespoons red-wine vinegar 
8 sheets gelatin 

For the garnish: 
2 tablespoons finely diced cucumber 
1 tablespoon finely diced red pepper 
1 tablespoon finely diced green pepper 
1 teaspoon finely diced chives 
4 pieces baby cilantro. 


1. Process vegetables in three batches, each with a third of the cumin, salt, cayenne and vinegar, until finely chopped, placing each batch in a sieve or colander lined with a double thickness of cheesecloth over a bowl. Gather the cheesecloth edges together and tie with string. Gently press (not squeeze) to extract the gazpacho water. Refrigerate overnight and allow water to release, weighing down the vegetables with cans or weights and turning frequently. 

2. Taste the gazpacho water and adjust seasoning. Soften the gelatin in a bowl of cold water. Warm 1 cup of the gazpacho water over medium heat and add the softened gelatin sheets. Cook slowly until melted and then stir into the remaining gazpacho liquid. Place in a shallow pan and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. 

3. To serve, finely chop the gelee and spoon into martini glasses. Garnish with finely diced vegetables and a sprig of the cilantro. 

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
