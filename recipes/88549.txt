Salad:
1/2-1 medium head of cabbage, shredded
1 boiled chicken breast (I use more if this is the main dish.)
2 diced green onions

Dry Stuff:
2 T. sliced almonds
2 T. toasted sesame seeds
1 pkg. instant ramen noodles, crumbled
1 c. sunflower seeds

Dressing: (I double the dressing)
1/2 c. oil
3 T. rice vinegar (or cider vinegar)
2 T. sugar
1 t. salt
1 t. MSG (Accent)
1/2 t. pepper

I make all three parts ahead of time. Then right before serving mix all together. If you don't mix it all you can store it for 3 or 4 days.
