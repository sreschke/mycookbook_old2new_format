Original recipe called for 1 lb. steak, which would have brought it under 30% CFF, but we like more meat in it. Russell Fletcher webauthor@bigfoot.com

Betsy's Notes: Made 2/14/00. Had 1 1/2 lbs of extra lean stew beef in cubes and used it just as it was (original recipe called for 1 lb of t-bone steak, and then sliced it thin). To make up for the extra beef I increased the broth to use the whole can (was 1 cup), and the flour (was 1/3 cup). And, because the extra beef gave me additional servings, I increased the noodle amount to give me the right nutritional analysis.
