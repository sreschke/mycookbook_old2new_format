Ma Yi Shang Shu
yield: 4 servings

4 ounces cellophane noodles [mung bean threads]
1/2 pound ground beef (top round)
5 1/2 tablespoons peanut or corn oil
2 tablespoons Hot Chili Bean Paste, Sichuan - or Hunan- style or to taste
1 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 cups Chicken Broth
3 tablespoons minced whole scallions

THE MARINADE
1 1/2 tablespoons light soy sauce
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon chicken broth
1 tablespoon peanut oil or corn oil

    Soak the cellophane noodles in hot water for 20 minutes; then drain and set aside until almost dry.  Cut them into 4- to 6-inch lengths with
scissors so they are easier to cook and serve.
    Put the meat in a mixing bowl, add the marinade ingredients, and mix well.
    Heat the wok over medium heat until very hot.  Add 5 tablespoons of the oil, heat, then add the beef.  Quickly stir-fry until the meat loses its
pinkness and is separated into bits.  Add the chili paste and sugar; stir and mix well.  Add the cellophane noodles and the broth and bring to a boil. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, or until all the broth is absorbed.  Toss the noodles until they are dry and fluffy.  Add the minced scallions and the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil and toss.  Scoop out to a platter and serve hot.  The dish may be kept covered, in a warm oven (200 degrees) for up to 15 minutes.
    To double, prepare the dish twice.
VARIATION: Ground pork can be used instead of beef.  In that case, omit the oil in the marinade.
