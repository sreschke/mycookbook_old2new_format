CAKE:
1  -18 oz pkg yellow cake mix (one without pudding)  I use Duncan Hines Butter Cake Mix 
1 Cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans)Chopped fine
1 small package vanilla instant pudding mix
4 eggs
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup dark rum
1/2 cup oil

GLAZE:
1/4 lb butter (1 stick)
1/4 cup water
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup rum

Grease and flour bundt or tube pan.  Tap to remove excess flour.  Place nuts in bottom of pan.

Combine cake mix, pudding mix, oil, water, oil and rum.  Beat well. 

Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well.  

Pour into pan; bake at 325   for 1 hour.  

Keep in pan while making glaze.

Glaze:
Combine sugar, butter, & water in a saucepan.  Boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.

Remove from heat 

Add Rum and mix well. This may be a bit strong. I still use 1/2 cup but diluting the rum with water. Sugar mixture will sizzle when rum is added. 

Poke holes in cake with a fork and pour glaze over cake. It will absorb glaze after standing for about 30 minutes. Remove from pan after all glaze is absorbed and cake is almost cooled.
