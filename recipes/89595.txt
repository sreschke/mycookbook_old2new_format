Roast chicken, simple and familiar as it is, remains one of the most perfectly pleasing meals. When prepared with honey and orange juice it is
elevated to special occasion status. Never refrigerate honey; if it crystallizes, place it in a saucepan of hot water or microwave until the
crystals dissolve. 

2 (3 pound) broiler-fryer chickens cut up
1 teaspoon salt 
freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 medium onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
