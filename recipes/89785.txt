(Serves 8 to 10)
lbs. crab meat (preferably blue)
1/4 c. each, minced red, green and yellow bell pepper
1-1-1/2 inner stalks of celery including leaves, minced
1/4 c. minced sweet red onion
1/2 jalapeno chile, seeded and minced
2 large eggs
1 T. tabasco
1-1/2 t. worcestershire
1/2 c. mayonnaise (see below)
1/2 - 3/4 c. fine bread crumbs
sherry-cayenne mayonnaise (a necessity, see below)
peanut oil for frying
lemon wedges

check the crab meat for pieces of shell and gently squeeze out any excess
moisture.  do not break up the larger pieces of meat, as these enhance the texture
of the crab cakes.  in a large bowl, combine all the crab cake ingredients, mixing
well but lightly.  form into cakes about 2 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch high.

to prepare the mayonnaise:

1 c. mayonnaise (see below)
1 t. cayenne
2 T. sherry vinegar

mix the mayonnaise, cayenne and vinegar together well.  refrigerate until needed.

heat the oil to 375 degrees.  deep-fry the crab cakes for about 3 minutes, or
until golden brown and crispy on the outside.  the crab cakes can also be
pan-fried, if you prefer.

serve 3 crab cakes per person and top with 1-1/2 to 2 teaspoons of sherry-cayenne
mayonnaise.  garnish each serving with a lemon wedge.

homemade (or i guess that would be restaurant) mayonnaise

makes 2 cups

2 egg yolks
1 T. rice or champagne vinegar
1 t. dijon mustard
tiny pinch of kosher or sea salt
freshly ground pepper
1-1-1/4 c. olive oil

whisk together the egg yolks, vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper in a medium-sized
bowl.  slowly whisk in the olive oil until thick.  if you use a blender, blend
together the egg yolks, vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper first.  then with the
blender running, slowly add the olive oil until the mayonnaise thickens.
