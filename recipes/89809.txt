King Chef Diner (Colorado Springs, CO)

Stale or Firm Bread (the thicker the better)
1 Egg per person
2 Tbsp Milk per person. 
Sugar & Salt

Heat a grill or griddle to pancake heat.  (that's HOT)  In a shallow soup bowl, mix the eggs thoroughly and add the milk.  Mix again.  Add a little sugar and even less salt.  Dip each slice of bread in the milk, turn, wait about five seconds, turn again, and put on the grill.  (Do this very quickly or you'll have egg all over everything.)  By the time you've done two servings it will be time to turn them all, starting with the first ones you put down.  Don't be afraid to take these off the grill when they're brown on both sides -- thick slices will continue to cook after you've taken them off.  Cut slices in half diagonally and arrange like a stack of paper hats.  (Presentation is everything!)  Butter while hot, and serve with hot syrup.
