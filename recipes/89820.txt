King Chef Diner (Colorado Springs, CO)

Colorado Green Chili (Chile Verde)
4 lb. Pork Roast diced or coarse (Chili) ground
2 lb. Ground Pork or Pork Sausage
2 Tbsp. Chicken Granules
3 Large Onions
18 Jalape¤o or 6 Green Habenero Peppers. 
2 Green Bell Peppers. 
1 Cup Rice
1 Tbsp. Black Pepper
Flour or pancake batter
(If you cut this recipe in half, use 4 or 5 Habeneros or it won't be hot enuf. <grin>)

1. Combine Pork, Chicken Granules and enuf water to cover, and cook for two or three hours, skimming scum at first and fat later.
 
2. Dice Onions, saut‚, peppering generously, and add to meat.    

3. Clean bell peppers. Dice all peppers and add to pork. (Purists might  saut‚ these first, but Sam didn't.  In fact, he froze jalapenos in season, and chopped them frozen and put them in his chili.  Some people use a variety of peppers.  Sam only used Jalepe¤os.  I add the bell peppers for color rather than flavor.   Add black pepper and salt to taste.  Cook some more. (about an hour, or until cubed pork is falling apart.)  

4. Add uncooked rice.  Cook until the rice and peppers are done (about 30 minutes.) 

5. Thicken somewhat with "roux".  Sam used pancake batter, since he had that sitting around the diner.  You can make up a slurry of flour and water, or cornstarch and water, and add it to the chili to thicken it a bit, or you could actually cook up a roux with flour and fat.  However, this chili is traditionally a lot thinner than Red Chili, and (like Cajun etouff‚) is used more as a sauce or gravy than as a standalone dish.  

Caution:  It is very easy to get carried away by adding too many hot peppers, and you will make this chili too hot for most people to eat!

You can bag this, freeze it, and thaw it as needed.
