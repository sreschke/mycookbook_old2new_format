 I just use an 8-oz bottle of Russian Salad Dressing and mix whole jar with the dry onion soup mix and jam... (I usually add just a bit more apricot jam, you can add more if you want to sweeter taste). I've never cooked 12 chicken breasts, (usually only 4 or 5, because I like to have lots of extra sauce to refrigerate or freeze in small containers for rice... it is so good over cooked rice or fried rice.
