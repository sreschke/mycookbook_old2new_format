With peppermint extract and red food coloring your kids can turn this simple dough into edible ornaments. (We made many little ones instead of the large ones the kids loved to eat and make these!)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  In large bowl, cream the butter and sugar.  Add the egg and beat well.  Stir in the peppermint and vanilla extracts.  Gradually mix in the flour.  Divide the dough in half.  Color one half with red food coloring; leave the other half plain.  Roll out a tablespoon of red and a table spoon of plain until they are each 6 to 8 inches lng.  Twist them into a candy cane, pinching the ends.  Repeat.  bake on an ungreased cookie sheet for 8 - 10 minutes, or until set but not brown.  Makes about 25.
