1 lb. Beef Round Tip Steaks, cut into 1/8-inch thick slices 
1 Jalapeno Pepper, finely chopped 
1 Tbs. Olive Oil 
1 package Beef Flavor Instant Noodles (like Ramen) 
1/4 cup Steak Sauce 
1 Medium Carrot, grated 
2 Tbs. Fresh Cilantro or Parsley, chopped 
2 Tbs. Green Onion, chopped 
1/4 cup Chopped Peanuts 

Stack beef steaks for easy cutting, and slice into 
thin strips. In a medium mixing bowl, combine beef, 
jalapeno pepper, and oil; toss to coat. 

Break noodles into 4 pieces, reserving the seasoning packet. Cook noodles as directed and drain. 

In a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, 
stir-fry the beef and pepper for about 2 minutes, about half at a time, until it is no longer pink. Be careful not to overcook the steak, so it won't become tough and chewy. Remove beef and pepper from the skillet and keep warm. 

In the same skillet, combine cooked noodles, steak 
sauce, carrot, cilantro or parsley, and green   onion. 

Sprinkle on reserved noodle seasoning, and cook 
over medium heat until warmed through, stirring 
occasionally. 

Return the beef and pepper to the skillet and lightly toss to combine with noodles. Sprinkle with peanuts, gently toss beef and noodles in the pan to combine and warm the peanuts. Serve warm.
