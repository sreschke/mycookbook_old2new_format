Fennel, Hazelnut and

Blue Cheese Salad

(4 servings)

This is one of those salads that make a weeknight meal something memorable. I like to serve it with grilled or roast meats or poultry.

1 bulb fennel, trimmed, halved, cored and thinly sliced (reserve a few fronds for garnish) 

3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Sugar to taste

1 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard

5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

4 tablespoons hazelnuts or walnut halves, toasted* and coarsely chopped 

4 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese

Place the fennel in a large bowl; set aside.

In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice and salt, pepper and sugar to taste. Whisking constantly, slowly add first the mustard, then the oil, adding the oil in a steady stream. Taste and adjust the seasonings accordingly.

Pour the vinaigrette over the fennel and toss to combine.

To serve, divide the salad evenly among 4 plates and sprinkle each with hazelnuts, cheese and the reserved snipped fennel fronds. Serve immediately.

* NOTE: To toast nuts, spread them on a baking sheet and place them in a 350-degree oven. Bake 8 to 10 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally. Watch carefully because nuts will burn quickly.
