2 pounds Idaho potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch thick slices 
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

Heat the oil in a deep fat fryer or large, heavy pot to 350 degrees F. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. 
Fry the potatoes in the oil until golden brown, turning to cook evenly, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. Season with Essence, to taste, and transfer to a baking sheet. Place in the oven to keep warm until ready to serve.
