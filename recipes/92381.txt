Barbecued Meat Balls

Meat Balls
1 (13 oz.) can evaporated milk
3 lbs. hamburger
2 cups quick oatmeal
2 eggs
1 cup onion, chopped (I also use dried, minced
onion with good results)
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. pepper
2 tsp. chili powder

Sauce
2 cups Ketchup
2 cups brown sugar
2 tsp. liquid smoke
1/2 tsp. garlic powder

Mix all the ingredients under the meatball section together.  (I have
learned its just easier to mix all of this with your hands.  Shape
into balls the size of walnuts, mine are always a bit bigger.  Place
in a single layer on a flat pan, with sides so it doesn't drip into
your oven.  Dissolve all the sauce ingredients in a saucepan and then
pour over each of the meatballs.  Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees.
