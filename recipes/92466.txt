
Andersen's Famous Split Pea Soup (makes 8 bowls)

1 quarts water
2 cups split peas (a 1 lb. bag)
1 celery stalk, chopped
1 large carrot, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1/4 tsp. ground thyme (I use dried because I've never had any ground thyme)
1 pinch cayenne
1 bayleaf
salt and pepper to taste (if you want)

Put everything in the pot and boil hard for 20 minutes, then slowly until peas are tender (maybe an hour or so?). Strain through a fine sieve and reheat to boiling point. I usually leave it just chunky the way it is, or I use an immersion blender
to puree it. Yumm...  I've thrown in cubed, peeled sweet potatoes or regular unpeeled potatoes. You could add a bit of curry powder for a different taste as well. Explore.... Enjoy!
