2 pounds lean ground beef
1 and 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 tsp. salt
2 eggs
1 small onion, minced
1/2 green pepper, cut into bite sized chunks
1/2 red pepper, cut into bite sized chunks
1 small onion, cut into bite sized chunks
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1 Tbs. Soy Sauce
1 tsp. dry mustard
3 Tbs. cornstarch
1 - 20 oz. can pineapple chunks, drained - reserving juice

To make meatballs: Combine the ground beef, bread crumbs, salt, eggs
and onions.  Mix well with hands and form into balls.  Place on a
broiler pan so the fat drains while cooking.  Set oven to broil and
cook meatballs with the door closed, turning once, watching carefully
until nicely browned.  Remove from oven and set aside.

Place the prepared green pepper, red pepper and onion in a covered
baking dish with some water.  Cook in the microwave 3 to 4 min.  or
until tender.  Drain and set aside.

To prepare sauce: Mix together the brown sugar, water, vinegar, Soy
Sauce, dry mustard, reserved pineapple juice, and cornstarch in a
large cooking pot.  Stir well.  Bring to a boil and cook until
thickened to the consistency you like.  Remove from heat and add the
drained pineapple and the cooked vegetables.  Add the cooked meatballs
and stir well.

Serve with white rice.  This can be served right away or placed in the
oven over the cooked rice for some additional baking.  This also
reheats well.
