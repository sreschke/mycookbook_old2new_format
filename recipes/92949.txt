Serves 6 for breakfast or brunch side
dish

4-5 large Russet Potatoes
OR 6-8 large Red skinned potatoes
1 large onion, diced medium size
1 large green pepper, seeded and
chopped medium size
1 large red pepper, seeded and chopped
medium size
1 large yellow pepper, seeded and
chopped medium size
1/2 pound bacon, cooked and chopped
1/2 link sausage, cooked and sliced in
about 1/4 inch slices
1 pint sour cream (or to taste.  I
like the dish moist)
1/4 - 1/2 Cup Parmesan cheese shredded
finely
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese coarsely

1.  Wash potatoes well.  No need to
peel.  Dice into medium sized
cubes.  Blanch in boiling water for
about 5 minutes.  Drain well.

2.  Cook bacon and sausage.  Drain and
slice.

3.  Dice the rest of the vegetables.
The idea is to be able to
identify all the veggies.  Saute until
wilted in bacon grease.  Remove
with slotted spoon and place on paper
towels to blot some of the
grease off.

4.  Combine all ingredients except
cheeses gently but thoroughly.
Pour into a casserole dish.

5.  Bake about 40 minutes in a 375*
oven.

6.  Top with combined cheese and bake
until cheese melts.

Serving suggestion: You can serve it
as is, or add scrambled eggs, and
wrap it all in large, heated flour
tortillas for breakfast
