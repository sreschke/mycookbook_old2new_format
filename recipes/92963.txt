 INGREDIENTS:
 
 1 (3 pound) chicken
 1/4 cup flour
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 1/4 teaspoon pepper
 1 teaspoon paprika
 1/4 cup butter or margarine
 1 (10-3/4 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
 1 (4 ounce) can mushrooms, undrained
 1 tablespoon white wine
 
 TO PREPARE:
 
 Cut chicken in quarters.  Combine flour, salt, pepper and 
 paprika in a paper bag.  Add chicken and shake to coat.  In 
 a 425 degree oven, melt butter in a shallow baking dish 
 which is just large enough to hold chicken.  Arrange 
 chicken in the baking dish skin side down.  Bake, 
 uncovered, for 30 minutes.  Remove dish from oven and turn 
 chicken over.  Reduce oven to 375 degrees.  Combine soup, 
 mushrooms and wine in a small saucepan.  Heat and stir 
 until blended.  Pour over chicken.  Bake 35 minutes more.  
 Stir in a little water during baking if more gravy is 
 desired.
