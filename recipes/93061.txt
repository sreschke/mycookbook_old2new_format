Cut meat into 1/2 inch thick by 2 inch long strips.
Saute the onions in butter until brown.
Place meat in pan with onions.  Sear quickly in frying pan along with onion.  (this seals the juices inside.)  Avoid overcooking the meat.
Add mushrooms, and stir in the wine, chives, and garlic for about 5 minutes.
Finally add sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, and chives, and simmer until it almost boils.
Serve on noodles or steamed white rice.

You may want to vary the thickness of the sauce.  I do this by adding sour cream to thicken, or adding wine to lighten.
