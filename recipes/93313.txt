It's so simple! In just 10 minutes you can make delicious frozen yogurt by blending your favorite frozen fruit with plain yogurt! And it's low-fat! 

Serving: Yields: about 2 1/2 cups
Cook Time: 10 minutes
Total Time: 10 minutes

 12 ounces frozen strawberries, cherries, or peaches (about 2 3/4 cups), or 10 ounces frozen raspberries (about 2 1/3 cups)
 1 container (8 ounces) plain low-fat yogurt
 1/2 cup sugar
 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
 1/8 teaspoon almond extract

1. In food processor, with knife blade attached, blend frozen fruit until fruit resembles finely shaved ice, stopping processor occasionally to scrape down side. If fruit is not finely shaved, dessert will not be smooth.

2. Add yogurt, sugar, lemon juice, and almond extract, and process just until mixture is smooth and creamy, scraping down side occasionally. Serve immediately. Or, spoon into freezer-safe containers and freeze to serve later; let stand at room temperature 10 minutes to soften slightly before serving.

Editor's Note: If you want to freeze fresh fruit yourself, spread a single layer of whole berries, pitted cherries, peeled and sliced peaches, nectarines, or plums, or melon chunks in 15 1/2-inch by 10 1/2-inch jelly-roll pan; freeze until firm. When frozen, place fruit in freezer-weight self-sealing plastic bag and return to freezer to use within three months.
