Mix Makara Cinnamon and sugar together in a small bowl and reserve for topping. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine butter, margarine and sugar; cream well. Add the eggs and beat again until light and fluffy. Sift dry ingredients together; add them to the egg/butter mixture and mix thoroughly. Chill dough one hour. Preheat oven to 400Ã¸. Form the chilled dough into 1" balls and roll them in reserved Makara Cinnamon and sugar. Place them on greased or parchment paper-lined baking sheets. Bake 8-10 minutes. Cookies will puff during baking, then fall, leaving a crackly sugar top. Makes 6 dozen cookies.
