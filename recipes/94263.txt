Mushroom caviar dip 
ÿÿHi All, 
This is one of our favorite mushroom recipes. I often serve this on Shabbat when we have a milhig meal. 
It is super alongside fried fish or as an appertiser. Once I served it over fresh fettucine. It was great. Alongside I served a bowl of both sliced fresh chilli in extra virgin olive oil and freshly grated parmesan cheese.
