Sweet and Sour Kielbasa
Hi Cindy, Here's a yummy , no fail and super easy app. 

3-5lbs of Kielbase cut into inch slices
1 small bottle of spicy brown mustard (any brand will do)
1 jar of red currant jelly

Throw everything in the crock pot, switch to low and let the mustard and jelly melt while the kielbasa warms. Takes about an hour. Give it the occasional stir to mix it all up. Nice and easy! - Worcester, MA
