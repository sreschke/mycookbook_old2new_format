2/3	cups melted butter (165m)

1/8	tsp salt

1 «	cups sour cream

Cinnamon is not needed unless you wish to sprinkle it on top of finished cake.

1.  Mix together the crushed graham crackers, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar, and melted butter.  Firmly 
press on the bottom and sides of a 10 inch pan (spring form).  Chill until ready to use.

2.  Soften the cream cheese and beat in the cup of sugar.

3.  Add the flour salt and mix well.

4.  Beat in the egg yolks plus the whole egg, sour cream, and lemon juice.

5.  Beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks then add the sugar and beat until stiff and fold 
in the egg whites into the cream cheese mixture.

6.  Pour into the prepared crust and bake in a 300 degree oven for 1 hour and 30 minutes.  Check 
the cake after a half hour since all ovens bake differently.  If the cake tester comes out clean 
and the cake is turning brown it probably is done.

Turn off the heat and let the cake cool in the oven.

Chill in the refrigerator until firm.  Serve with sprinkled cinnamon or use ONE PIE CAN OF CHERRIE 
PIE FILLING for topping.

Serves 10.

Preferred Crust:
Grease a 9 or 10 inch spring form pan dust with crushed graham cracker crumbs...this is just as 
good.
