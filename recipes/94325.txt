329den 

12 cups chicken broth (I like to use boullion or stock) 
2 pounds ground chicken 
2 small packages frozen spinach 
4 eggs 
parsley 
celery salt 
2 large zucchini 
3 T. olive oil 
Make 1 1/2" balls with ground chicken. Bring chicken broth to a boil and drop in chicken balls. When cooked (when they rise to the top), add the frozen spinach and about two tablespoons of parsley. Then add about 2 tsp. of celery salt (if you have it). When ready to serve, add beaten eggs and stir. Slice peeled zucchini lengthwise about 1/4 inch. Saute in olive oil until soft. Place cooked zucchini in bowl and pour soup over top. Done! Serves 4 for a main dish. I used ground chicken instead of ground turkey and it was wonderful.
