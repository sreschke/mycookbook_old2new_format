6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped  
3/4 cup sugar  
1 teaspoon espresso coffee, powder  
pinch salt  
6 tablespoons boiling water  
12 tablespoons butter, at room temperature  
3 large eggs, at room temperature  
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
confectioners sugar, for dusting  
sweetened whipped cream, for serving 

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 6 1/2 inch springform pan. Line the bottom with a round or parchment or wax paper and grease the paper.

2. Combine the chocolate, sugar, espresso powder and salt in a food processor and process until finely ground. With the machine running, add the boiling water and process for 10 to 15 seconds or until the chocolate is melted. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.

3. Add the butter in tablespoons and process until smooth. Add the eggs and vanilla and process just until well blended. 

4. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the edges of the cake are puffy and the center is just set and no longer wet-looking.

5. Cool the cake in the pan set on a wire rack for 30 minutes. The cake will crack and sink as it cools. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight.

6. To serve, run a thin-bladed knife around the edge of the cake. Release and remove the sides of the springform pan. Invert the cake onto a serving plate. Carefully remove the bottom of the pan and peel off the paper. Dust the cake with confectioners' sugar. Cut into wedges and serve with whipped cream.

Serve this deliciously dense, rich cake with a garnish of fresh raspberries, if you like. It's easy to make, since the batter is mixed in minutes in the food processor.
