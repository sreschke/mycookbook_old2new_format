Ingredients 
4 cups flour* 
1/4 ounce dry yeast dissolved in 1/4 cup lukewarm water 
1 to 1 1/4 cups lukewarm water 
1 teaspoon salt 
1/4 cup mild flavor olive oil
Allow dissolved yeast to double in size, and then mix all ingredients together (by hand or machine) and knead to a smooth elastic dough. Place in an oiled bowl and cover with a towel. Let rest for at least two hours; dough should double in size.

Divide dough into four or five balls. Flatten one ball at a time and stretch to a thin disc about 10 inches in diameter with a thickened edge. Place toppings onto pizza to about one inch from the edges. Remember to keep the toppings light and fresh so that the pizza will cook in about 3 minutes.
