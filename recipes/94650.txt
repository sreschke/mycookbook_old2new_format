"Classic Penne Carbonara"

1 lb. dried penne 
10 slices of pancetta or bacon
olive oil
5 organic egg yolks (I use 3 whole eggs, well beaten)
7 Tbsp. heavy cream
4 1/2 oz. fresh parmesan cheese, grated
salt & freshly ground black pepper

Cook the penne in salted boiling water until al dente. While the pasta's cooking, slowly fry the pancetta in a little oil until crispy. Break it up a bit, then put to one side. In a bowl, whip up the egg yolks, cream, and half the parmesan. When the pasta is cooked, drain and immediately toss with the warm, crispy pancetta and the egg mixture. A lot of carbonara's are overcooked and resemble a scrambled egg sauce - it you add the penne immediately the residual heat is enough to cook the egg and for the sauce to stay smooth and silky. Season well, using plenty of freshly ground black pepper and add extra parmesan to taste. Serve straight away, with a big bowl of salad and a nice bottle of red wine."
