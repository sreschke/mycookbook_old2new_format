Chocolate Chip Cookies

1 cup margarine ( I use either soya or vegetable)
2/3 cup white sugar
2/3 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
1 tsp baking soda
2 cups all purpose flour
1-1/2 cup chocolate chips
Cream the margarine with the sugars,egg, vanilla,baking soda and chocolate chips. Add the flour and mix well. I always add just enough flour that I can handle the dough without it being too sticky. Don't add too much or they will be dry. It's all trial and erro. You'll discover what "feels" right.
Roll the dough into balls about 2 1/2". Place on the disposable pan. Flatten slightly with a fork.
Bake at 350* till golden.
My biggest tip:
At least twice during the baking process, when the cookies start to "puff" up flatten them with a spatula or something..just give them a good smack. This keeps the cookies thin and chewy. I also underbake a cookie by at least one minute because they continue to bake slightly when they are taken out of the oven..If you need some tried and true recipes..I'll post them.
I've been baking cookies for over 20 yrs and very rarely have a batch not turn out, so hopefully you can get the hang of it and it will restore the enjoyment of baking cookies!
Good luck and have fun!
