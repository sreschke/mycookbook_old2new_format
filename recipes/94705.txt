4--6 lb. forerib/standing rib of beef

Heat oven to 375F.  Mix the spices, sugar, cornstarch, and pepper
together, adding more of a particular spice, if you like.  Rub some of
the seasoning mix onto all surfaces of the beef.  Reserve the rest.
Put beef in a roasting pan and place in the oven.  (The pan needs to
be big enough to fit the roast in, it doesn't need to be covered.) Put
unpeeled onions into a pan of water and par-boil for 10 minutes.
Place in cold water, then peel, leaving pointed ends untrimmed.  Trim
root ends.  Coat onions lightly with oil and sprinkle with a little of
the remaining seasoning mix.  Place around the beef.  Roast Beef per
lb.; 25 minutes for rare, 30 to 35 minutes for medium, 40 to 45
minutes for well done.  Turn the oven up to 425F.  for 15 to 20
minutes before end of roasting to brown the onions.  Remove beef and
onions and keep warm.  Pour off all but 2 Tbs.  of fat and mix in the
flour.  Brown lightly, scraping the pan.  Cook until thickened, add
seasoning and more stock, if too thick.  Serve with the sliced beef,
onions and mashed potatoes and a nice green salad.
