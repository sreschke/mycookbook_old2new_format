IN A LARGE SOUP POT. BROWN SOUP BONES OR SHORT RIBS. REMOVE FROM POT. SAUTE ONIONS BELLPEPPER AND CELERY AND GARLIC, UNTIL TENDER ABOUT 5 MIN. ADD MEAT BACK TO POT. ADD CHICKEN STOCK OR WATER. ADD CABBAGE. LET BOIL UNTIL CABBAGE IS WILTED AS IT TAKES UP SO MUCH ROOM. ADD ALL THE REST OF THE VEG. COVER WITH WATER. ADD SALT AND PEPPER. BRING BACK TO A BOIL. ADD TOMATOE PASTE. LET BOIL ON MED TO LOW HEAT MOST OF THE DAY. KEEP ADDING WATER AND TASTING FOR SEASONING AS NEEDED.  (SOMETIMES I ADD A FEW VERMICILLE SM SPAGETTI) AT THE LAST BOIL UNTIL SOFT. SERVE WITH CRACKERS. THIS IS ENOUGH TO FREEZE AND LAST ALL WINTER.
