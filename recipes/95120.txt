Boil water for pasta with 1 tbsp. kosher salt. Trim woody ends off asparagus spears (leaving about 3/4) and chop remaining into 2-inch pieces. Seed bell pepper and cut into small strips. Take sausage meat out of casing and fry in olive oil in wok or other large fry pan. Break sausage into small pieces, and add crushed red pepper flakes (to suit desired spiciness, using less for hot turkey sausage.) Begin to boil the pasta (6-8 min. for al dente). While this is cooking, add asparagus, mushrooms, and red pepper strips to same pan with sausage. Stir-fry over medium-high heat for ~5 minutes until vegetables are crisp-tender. Turn off heat, and drain pasta. Toss drained pasta with vegetable-turkey mixture, adding a small amount of extra virgin olive oil if desired. Add salt & pepper to taste. Allow to cool for 5-10 min. (Dish is served warm, not piping hot. May also be served room temperature or cold on hot days.) After cooling slightly, toss lightly with feta and chopped parsley. Serve with lemon wedges, crusty bread and white wine for easy summer entertaining. Calories: 582  Carbs: 66  Fat: 23g  Protein: 31g  * Healthy, satisfying and makes a quick summer meal.
