4 Servings
8 ounces penne 					
1 pound fresh green beans 
8 ounces broccoli flowerettes, from the salad bar 		
1 small onion 
2 garlic cloves 					
1 28-ounce can whole tomatoes 
2 tablespoons fresh basil 				
2 teaspoons olive oil 
1/2 cup light sour cream 				
2 tablespoons skim milk 
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese 			
Pinch ground nutmeg 
In a large pot, covered, bring 3 quarts water to boil.  Add 8 oz penne to boiling water, and cook for the shorter amount of time specified on the package.  Slice the 1 lb. green beans in half. Add beans and 8 oz broccoli flowerettes to pasta for the last 3 min. of cooking time.  Meanwhile, chop 1 onion and 2 garlic cloves; drain tomatoes and chop coarsely. Slice or tear enough fresh basil to equal 2 tbsp; set aside. In large non-stick skillet, heat 2 tsp olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until softened, ~3 min. Add chopped tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until hot, ~ 4 min. Remove skillet from heat and stir in basil, 1/2 cup light sour cream, 2 tbsp skim milk, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and pinch nutmeg. Drain pasta and vegetables and return to pot. Add cream sauce and toss thoroughly. Divide the pasta among 4 heated serving bowls.  Serve with Greens with Fresh Fruit and Balsamic Vinegar and whole grain breadsticks, low-sodium or salt-free if desired.  *If your cream sauce is a bit too thick, use some of the pasta cooking water to thin it--just remember to save a bit before you drain the pasta!
