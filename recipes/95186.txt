I take a 1/2 stick of margarine get it nice and hot and add sliced green onions, lots of minced garlic and sun dried tomatoes (chopped), cook all up till soft. I set this aside. and brown the other 1/2 stick of margarine......cook till golden brown.

 then i quickly add garlic mixture stir and toss with cooked Penne pasta. Add salt and pepper to taste, and fresh grated parmesan cheese. (Not the one in the green can, i mean the real stuff.) I sometimes sprinke a few chopped walnuts on top. mmmm yummers.
