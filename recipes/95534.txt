Ingredients:

6 ounce orange juice, fresh or bottled 
1 tablespoon orange peel, grated 
1 teaspoon tarragon, ground 
1/8 teaspoon black pepper 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
2 teaspoon brown sugar, measured packed 
4 ounce dalmon, uncooked 
4 tablespoon rice, brown, uncooked 
2 teaspoon cornstarch 
1 tablespoon wine, madeira 
2 tablespoon sour cream, low-fat 
1/2 green beans, frozen 10oz pkg 

Directions:

Whisk together orange juice, orange peel, tarragon, black pepper, salt and brown sugar in a shallow container (adjust pepper and tarragon as necessary per your taste preference). Place measured amount of salmon, flesh side down, in this marinade. Cover container tightly with plastic wrap or foil. 

Place in the refrigerator and marinate at least one hour, but as long as overnight. If you are going to cook salmon after one hour of marinating, then set rice to cook according to package instructions. After marinating salmon, remove from marinade and grill or broil. While salmon broils or grills, place marinade into nonstick skillet. Bring to a boil; boil 5 minutes. Reduce heat to a simmer. 

Blend cornstarch into Madeira wine. If you do not have Madeira wine, substitute an equal amount of Balsamic vinegar with 1 teaspoon sugar for the wine. Blend this paste into the orange juice sauce that you have boiled for five minutes. Whisk in measured amount of sour cream. 

Serve the salmon and rice with the wonderfully rich yet light sauce. Add green beans to the side.
