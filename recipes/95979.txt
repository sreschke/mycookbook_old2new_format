This recipe serves two but it can be easily doubled to serve four. In order to effectively beat the egg whites, make sure your bowl and beater are dry
and grease-free.  

2 teaspoons soft butter
2-1/2 tablespoons sugar
2 ounces semi-sweet chocolate
1/4 cup milk
2 large eggs, separated
1 egg white
confectioners' sugar

Butter the insides of 2 individual souffle dishes or ramekins, each about 3-1/2" in diameter and 2-inches deep.  Sprinkle them with 1/2 tablespoon
sugar, making sure a fine coating adheres to the sides of the ramekins.

Place ramekins in refrigerator. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave oven.  Combine the chocolate and milk.  When the mixture is smooth, add the egg yolks, one at a time, beating them in with a whisk.  Beat the egg whites until soft, then
add the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar.  Beat until stiff, but not dry.  Place 1/3 of the mixture on top of the chocolate and mix in with the whisk.
 Fold the remaining whites into the chocolate with a rubber spatula.  Pour the mixture into the ramekins; it should reach to the rim of the mold. At
this point the souffles can be kept for a good hour at room temperature.  

At baking time, place the ramekins on a baking sheet in the middle of the preheated oven.  Turn down the heat to 375 degrees.  Bake for 10 to 15
minutes, or until nicely puffed up. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
