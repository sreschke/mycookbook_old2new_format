Susan's Alfredo Sauce 

1/2 stick   butter
4 cloves    minced garlic (You can also use the pre-chopped kind that comes 
in a jar)
1 cup   heavy cream
4 T     chopped parsley
to taste    cayenne pepper (makes the sauce turn pink)
2 t     freshly ground pepper
to taste    salt
1.5 cups    shredded Asiago cheese (or freshly shredded parmesan)
cooked  pasta of choice

Boil the water for the pasta (I've been using angel hair, and I'm terrible at 
measuring it; the sauce is enough for 2-3 servings). Add pasta when it starts 
boiling. Melt the butter in a large pan, saute garlic briefly, but don't let 
it brown. Add cream, parsley, cayenne pepper, black pepper and salt. Stir 
with a whisk to combine and cook until heated through and it starts to 
thicken. Gradually add cheese and stir (once you add the cheese, you should 
stir with something besides a whisk). 

When the pasta is al dente (firm, not tough, but not completely soft), drain 
and add it to the sauce. Stir, making sure pasta is coated and cook gently 
until the sauce has absorbed into the pasta somewhat. Serve topped with a 
little extra cheese and parsley.
