2 cups chicken stock                                                                    
Chili oil to taste (*caution - this is very hot!) or use fresh Thai chili peppers 

2 chicken breast filets, cut into small bite size pieces 

(or use chicken tenderloins, cut up)                

2 cans coconut milk, this can be found in most grocery stores in the Asian foods section 

3 green onions, minced

1 tsp. freshly grated ginger root, do not use dry ginger powder 

1/4 cup whole straw mushrooms 

2 stalks lemongrass, roughly chopped                                  

3 tbsp. fish sauce 

several sprigs of cilantro, roughly chopped                 

juice of 1 lime 

 

(note* kaffir lime leaves and galangal are sometimes used in this recipe however because most of us can't find these ingredients locally, they have been replaced with only slight variation in taste.)

Add lemongrass & chicken to stock and simmer 15-20 minutes.   You can remove lemongrass with a slotted spoon if you like or leave it in large chunks to be avoided as it is really too woody to eat.  Add fish sauce, coconut milk,  chili oil, mushrooms, green onions, ginger, lime juice and cilantro.  Simmer, not a high boil, about 10 minutes to heat all ingredients through and serve.

Serves 4-6
