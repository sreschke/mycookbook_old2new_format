Sprinkle chops with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a frying pan and cook chops in two batches for 2 minutes on each side. When all chops are cooked, return first batch to pan. Remove from heat.
Pur‚e the tomatoes with juice, tomato pur‚e and Worcestershire sauce in a blender, drained corn (use some of the corn water if the mixture is too thick). Bring back to a boil and add salt and pepper.
Cover pan and cook over moderate heat for 25 minutes. Remove lid to reduce sauce a little and cook for further 10 minutes. Thicken with arrowroot, if you like, blended with a little hot water, and cook until clear. Garnish with parsley and serve straight from the pan.
Serves four.
