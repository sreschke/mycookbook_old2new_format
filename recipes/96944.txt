HEAVENLY DAINTIES

  2 packages (6 oz.) butterscotch chips
1 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup butter
1 package miniature marshmallows

 Mix chips, butter and peanut butter together in the top of a double boiler.
Heat and stir until melted (I do this in the microwave now).
Stir in half of the marshmallows and stir until melted.
Remove from heat and allow to cool about 10 minutes.
Stir in remaining marsmallows, when the mixture is cool enough - they should
not melt.
Spread in a 9 x 13 pan and chill.
