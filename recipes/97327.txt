Ingredients 

2 cups white sugar 
1 tablespoon corn syrup 
4 tablespoons cocoa powder 
« cup 1% milk 
¬ cup evaporated milk 
2 tablespoons butter 
1 tsp vanilla 
Method

Whisk together sugar, corn syrup, cocoa, and milks in a heavy bottomed pot and cook over a low heat until the sugar is melted. Turn the heat up a little and cover the pot. Simmer for 2- 3 minutes, turning the heat down if necessary to keep from boiling over. Remove the lid and boil with a candy thermometer in it until the temperature reaches 236F. Do not stir the mixture at all while it is boiling. 

Transfer to a stainless bowl and place the butter on top. Do not stir in. Let sit undisturbed for 15-20 minutes. Add the vanilla and whisk until the chocolate is the texture of very thick icing. Transfer to a 8X8 Pyrex dish that has been sprayed with nonstick spray. Cover and chill. Cut into 16 pieces. This can be made ahead; I prefer the texture after refrigerating overnight.
