In a large skillet coated with non-stick cooking spray, saut‚ onion several minutes or until it begins to soften. Add artichokes and garlic and continue cooking until onion is tender. Add rice, stir and cook until rice is opaque, 1 to 3 minutes. Add the wine or broth and cook, stirring frequently, until liquid is completely absorbed, about 3 minutes.
       
Heat the beef broth in the microwave or in saucepan on the stove until hot. Add 1/2 cup of the heated broth to the rice mixture, stirring frequently, until most of the liquid is absorbed, 3 to 5 minutes. Continue adding remaining broth, « cup at a time, stirring constantly and letting liquid absorb after each addition. Cook until rice is creamy and the kernels just slightly ?chewy,? about 25 minutes. If more liquid is needed, use water.
