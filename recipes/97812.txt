Ingredients:
1 lb lentils, rinsed and sorted through
1 bay leaf
3 large carrots, peeled and sliced
2 stalks of celery, chopped
1 large onion, chopped
2 cups crushed tomatoes (canned or fresh)
2 Tbsp olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
balsamic vinegar (optional)

Method:
Cook the lentils in a big soup pot with about 6" of water above them. This nasty scuz will form on top -scrape most of it off (hint: pull the pot half-off
the burner to lower the heat and it's easier to catch the scum with your spoon). After it's
boiling hard and you get the scum off, lower the heat and boil gently for 20-30 minutes. Then, add your chopped up celery, carrots, and onion. Cook another 20-30 minutes. Then, add tomatoes, olive oil, and a wee bit of salt and pepper. Cook until the lentils are creamy-soft. Optional: Transfer all/part to a blender to give it a more pureed 
consistency.

To serve, each person can drizzle balsamic vinager (or even a little more olive oil as well) to taste into their bowl... and maybe salt and pepper, too.
