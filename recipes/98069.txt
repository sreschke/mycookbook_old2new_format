Swiss Cheese Fondue
(Makes About 2-1/2 Cups; Serves 6?8)

2 cups (8 oz) shredded Gruyere cheese 
2 cups (8 oz) shredded Swiss or Emmental cheese  
1 Tbs cornstarch
1 cup dry white wine 
1 Tbs fresh lemon juice, strained
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 Tbs brandy or Cognac, (optional)
white pepper and nutmeg to taste

Toss cheeses and cornstarch together in a mixing bowl. In a large, heavy saucepan, bring wine, lemon juice, and garlic to a simmer over medium heat?bubbles should just break the surface. Remove garlic and discard.
Add handfuls (about 1 cup) of cheese to simmering wine, stirring with a wooden spoon. Make sure cheese has nearly melted before adding more. Increase heat slightly if cheese doesn't seem to want to melt, but don't boil. Add brandy, pepper, and nutmeg to melted cheese. Transfer to fondue pot over medium flame (it can bubble gently, but don't boil). To eat, spear dippers on forks and swirl in fondue (stir to the bottom to prevent separating). By the end of the party, a crust of browned cheese will have formed on the bottom of the pot. Pry it off while it's warm and serve.
