Susan M. of Wakeman, Ohio, ?After finding out my mother had diabetes, I
went on a search for  good recipes like this. These bites taste so
yummy, no one will ever guess they?re low in  anything!?

 3 tablespoons sugar
 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
 10 flour tortillas (6 inches)
 1 package (8 ounces) reduced-fat cream cheese, softened
 1 cup cold fat-free milk
 1 package (1 ounce) sugar-free instant white chocolate or vanilla
pudding mix
 2 cups reduced-fat whipped topping
 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips, melted

 In a small bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon. Coat one side of each
tortilla with
 nonstick cooking spray; sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. Turn tortillas
over; repeat on the
 other side. Cut each tortilla into four wedges. For each dessert cup,
place round edge of
 one tortilla wedge in the bottom of a muffin cup, shaping sides to fit
cup. Place a second
 tortilla wedge in muffin cup, allowing bottom and sides to overlap.
Bake at 350Ã¸ for 10
 minutes or until crisp and lightly browned. Cool completely in pan.

 Meanwhile, for filling, beat cream cheese in a mixing bowl until
smooth. In another mixing
 bowl, beat milk and pudding mix on low speed for 2 minutes. Beat in
cream cheese on
 low until smooth. Fold in whipped topping. Cover and refrigerate for 1
hour. Carefully
 remove cups from pan. Pipe or spoon about 3 tablespoons filling into
each cup. Drizzle
 or pipe with melted chocolate. Refrigerate for 5 minutes or until
chocolate is set. Store in
 the refrigerator. Yield: 20 servings.
