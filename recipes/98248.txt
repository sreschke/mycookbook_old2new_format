The acid in the wine helps tenderize the meat in addition to contributing flavor. Use a decent, drinkable wine. 

3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
salt and freshly ground pepper
2 to 4 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1-1/2 inch cubes
16 pearl onions, peeled
8 ounces small fresh mushrooms
2 cups chopped onions
1/2 cup chopped carrot
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 cups dry red wine 
1 cup beef broth
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon thyme

Mix flour and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper.  Pat beef dry; coat with flour mixture and shake off excess.  Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a non-aluminum metal 6 quart casserole over medium-high heat.  Add 7 or 8 pieces of beef to skillet and brown on all sides.  Remove with a slotted
spoon and drain on paper toweling.  

Repeat with remaining beef, adding 1 tablespoon of oil if needed.  Add pearl onions; cook over low heat, covered, until onions brown slightly, stirring occasionally.  Then add mushrooms; cook, stirring 3 minutes.  With slotted spoon, remove onions and mushrooms.  Add remaining tablespoon of oil if needed; add chopped onions and carrot and saute, stirring frequently, until onions are translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add garlic and cook 30 seconds.  Pour in wine and broth and scrape up browned bits on bottom of pan with a wooden spoon. Add tomato paste, 1 tablespoon parsley and thyme. Bring to a boil; remove from heat. Return reserved beef to casserole. 

Place casserole over low heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally for 1 hour. Return onions and mushrooms to casserole and cook another 30 minutes, or until beef is tender when pierced with fork, about 1-1/2 hours.  If sauce is too thin, increase heat to high and boil until slightly thickened. Skim off any fat from the surface. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley. Serve directly from the casserole. 

Serves 8.
