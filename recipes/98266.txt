Cream Cheese Pound Cake

1 8 oz. pkg. cream cheese, softened
3 sticks real butter
4 eggs
2 c. sugar
3 c. all-purpose flour
2 tsps. vanilla


Cream eggs,butter,cream cheese,sugar and vanilla until smooth. Add flour and beat well.This batter will be very thick. Pour into a sprayed bundt pan and bake at 325 for 1 1/2 hours.

*Sometimes 1 1/2 is too long- depending on your oven.It has to be watched after an hour so it doesnt get too brown.
No need to frost at all.
