Tenderize the chicken breasts until about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch thick and set aside. On a piece of waxed paper, mix the parsley, bread crumbs, and parmesean cheese to taste. Pour milk in a bowl big enough put in a piece of chicken. Dip the chicken in the milk, then in the crumb mixture to coat the piece lightly. Place in the pan. Once all pieces are coated and in the pan, pour the spaghetti sauce evenly over the chicken. Palce the slices of mozzarella on top of the sauce so that the top is covered. Bake for 20-30 minutes on 350 degrees. Serve over cooked spaghetti noodles.
