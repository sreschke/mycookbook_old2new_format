Combine the first 8 items. Usally I will add some saltine crackers to make the loaf more firm. Shape into loaf & place in center of roasting pan. Cut bacon into thirds & drape across loaf. Surround by vegetables. Add 2 cups water, cover & bake at 350 degrees for 1 1/2hrs. Meanwhile in a custard cup, combine catsupe W-sauce & soy sauce. Spread over meatloaf after cooking time. Return to oven for another 15 minutes.
